         (c) the time at which he is to attend before the Court.
    (3) Whenever security is taken under this section, the officer to whom the warrant is directed shall forward the
bond to the Court.
     72. Warrants to whom directed.—(1) A warrant of arrest shall ordinarily be directed to one or more police
officers; but the Court issuing such a warrant may, if its immediate execution is necessary and no police officer is
immediately available, direct it to any other person or persons, and such person or persons shall execute the same.
   (2) When a warrant is directed to more officers or persons than one, it may be executed by all, or by any one or
more of them.
     73. Warrant may be directed to any person.—(1) The Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first
class may direct a warrant to any person within his local jurisdiction for the arrest of any escaped convict,
proclaimed offender or of any person who is accused of a non-bailable offence and is evading arrest.
   (2) Such person shall acknowledge in writing the receipt of the warrant, and shall execute it if the person for
whose arrest it was issued, is in, or enters on, any land or other property under his charge.
     (3) When the person against whom such warrant is issued is arrested, he shall be made over with the warrant to
the nearest police officer, who shall cause him to be taken before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, unless
security is taken under section 71.
    74. Warrant directed to police officer.—A warrant directed to any police officer may also be executed by any
other police officer whose name is endorsed upon the warrant by the officer to whom it is directed or endorsed.
     75. Notification of substance of warrant.—The police officer or other person executing a warrant of arrest
shall notify the substance thereof to the person to be arrested, and, if so required, shall show him the warrant.
    76. Person arrested to be brought before Court without delay.—The police officer or other person executing
a warrant of arrest shall (subject to the provisions of section 71 as to security) without unnecessary delay bring the
person arrested before the Court before which he is required by law to produce such person:
    Provided that such delay shall not, in any case, exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time necessary for the
journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s Court.
    77. Where warrant may be executed.—A warrant of arrest may be executed at any place in India.
      78. Warrant forwarded for execution outside jurisdiction.—(1) When a warrant is to be executed outside the
local jurisdiction of the Court issuing it, such Court may, instead of directing the warrant to a police officer within
its jurisdiction, forward it by post or otherwise to any Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent of Police or
Commissioner of Police within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it is to be executed; and the Executive
Magistrate or District Superintendent or Commissioner shall endorse his name thereon, and if practicable, cause it to
be executed in the manner hereinbefore provided.
      (2) The Court issuing a warrant under sub-section (1) shall forward, along with the warrant, the substance of
the information against the person to be arrested together with such documents, if any, as may be sufficient to enable
the Court acting under section 81 to decide whether bail should or should not be granted to the person.
     79. Warrant directed to police officer for execution outside jurisdiction.—(1) When a warrant directed to a
police officer is to be executed beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court issuing the same, he shall ordinarily take it
                                                           48
for endorsement either to an Executive Magistrate or to a police officer not below the rank of an officer in charge of
a police station, within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the warrant is to be executed.
    (2) Such Magistrate or police officer shall endorse his name thereon and such endorsement shall be sufficient
authority to the police officer to whom the warrant is directed to execute the same, and the local police shall, if so
required, assist such officer in executing such warrant.
    (3) Whenever there is reason to believe that the delay occasioned by obtaining the endorsement of the
Magistrate or police officer within whose local jurisdiction the warrant is to be executed will prevent such
execution, the police officer to whom it is directed may execute the same without such endorsement in any place
beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court which issued it.
     80. Procedure on arrest of person against whom warrant issued.—When a warrant of arrest is executed
outside the district in which it was issued, the person arrested shall, unless the Court which issued the warrant is
within thirty kilometres of the place of arrest or is nearer than the Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent
of Police or Commissioner of Police within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the arrest was made, or unless
security is taken under section 71, be taken before such Magistrate or District Superintendent or Commissioner.
     81. Procedure by Magistrate before whom such person arrested is brought.—(1) The Executive Magistrate
or District Superintendent of Police or Commissioner of Police shall, if the person arrested appears to be the person
intended by the Court which issued the warrant, direct his removal in custody to such Court:
    Provided that, if the offence is bailable, and such person is ready and willing to give bail to the satisfaction of
such Magistrate, District Superintendent or Commissioner, or a direction has been endorsed under section 71 on the
warrant and such person is ready and willing to give the security required by such direction, the Magistrate, District
Superintendent or Commissioner shall take such bail or security, as the case may be, and forward the bond, to the
Court which issued the warrant:
    Provided further that if the offence is a non-bailable one, it shall be lawful for the Chief Judicial Magistrate
(subject to the provisions of section 437), or the Sessions Judge, of the district in which the arrest is made on
consideration of the information and the documents referred to in sub-section (2) of section 78, to release such
person on bail.
    (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent a police officer from taking security under section 71.
                                          C.—Proclamation and attachment
    82. Proclamation for person absconding.—(1) If any Court has reason to believe (whether after taking
evidence or not) that any person against whom a warrant has been issued by it has absconded or is concealing
himself so that such warrant cannot be executed, such Court may publish a written proclamation requiring him to
appear at a specified place and at a specified time not less than thirty days from the date of publishing such
proclamation.
    (2) The proclamation shall be published as follows:—
        (i) (a) it shall be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village in which such person
    ordinarily resides;
         (b) it shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in which such person ordinarily
    resides or to some conspicuous place of such town or village;
         (c) a copy thereof shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the Court-house;
       (ii) the Court may also, if it thinks fit, direct a copy of the proclamation to be published in a daily
    newspaper circulating in the place in which such person ordinarily resides.
      (3) A statement in writing by the Court issuing the proclamation to the effect that the proclamation was duly
published on a specified day, in the manner specified in clause (i) of sub-section (2), shall be conclusive evidence
that the requirements of this section have been complied with, and that the proclamation was published on such day.


                                                          49
     1
     [(4) Where a proclamation published under sub-section (1) is in respect of a person accused of an offence
punishable under section 302, 304, 364, 367, 382, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 402, 436, 449, 459 or
460 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), and such person fails to appear at the specified place and time required
by the proclamation, the Court may, after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, pronounce him a proclaimed offender
and make a declaration to that effect.
    (5) The provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) shall apply to a declaration made by the Court under
sub-section (4) as they apply to the proclamation published under sub-section (1).]
    83. Attachment of property of person absconding.—(1) The Court issuing a proclamation under
section 82 may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, at any time after the issue of the proclamation, order
the attachment of any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person:
    Provided that where at the time of the issue of the proclamation the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or
otherwise, that the person in relation to whom the proclamation is to be issued,—
           (a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or
        (b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local jurisdiction of the
     Court,
it may order the attachment simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation.
     (2) Such order shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person within the
district in which it is made; and it shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person
without such district when endorsed by the District Magistrate within whose district such property is
situate.
     (3) If the property ordered to be attached is a debt or other movable property, the attachment under
this section shall be made—
           (a) by seizure; or
           (b) by the appointment of a receiver; or
         (c) by an order in writing prohibiting the delivery of such property to the proclaimed person or to
     any one on his behalf; or
           (d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.
    (4) If the property ordered to be attached is immovable, the attachment under this section shall, in the
case of land paying revenue to the State Government, be made through the Collector of the district in
which the land is situate, and in all other cases—
           (a) by taking possession; or
           (b) by the appointment of a receiver; or
         (c) by an order in writing prohibiting the payment of rent on delivery of property to the
     proclaimed person or to any one on his behalf; or
           (d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.
    (5) If the property ordered to be attached consists of live-stock or is of a perishable nature, the Court
may, if it thinks it expedient, order immediate sale thereof, and in such case the proceeds of the sale shall
abide the order of the Court.
    (6) The powers, duties and liabilities of a receiver appointed under this section shall be the same as
those of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).

    84. Claims and objections to attachment.—(1) If any claim is preferred to, or objection made to the
attachment of, any property attached under section 83, within six months from the date of such
attachment, by any person other than the proclaimed person, on the ground that the claimant or objector
has an interest in such property, and that such interest is not liable to attachment under section 83, the
claim or objection shall be inquired into, and may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part:
   Provided that any claim preferred or objection made within the period allowed by this sub-section
may, in the event of the death of the claimant or objector, be continued by his legal representative.
    (2) Claims or objections under sub-section (1) may be preferred or made in the Court by which the
order of attachment is issued, or, if the claim or objection is in respect of property attached under an order
endorsed under sub-section (2) of section 83, in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of the district
in which the attachment is made.
    (3) Every such claim or objection shall be inquired into by the Court in which it is preferred or made:
    Provided that, if it is preferred or made in the Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate, he may make it
over for disposal to any Magistrate subordinate to him.
    (4) Any person whose claim or objection has been disallowed in whole or in part by an order under
sub-section (1) may, within a period of one year from the date of such order, institute a suit to establish
the right which he claims in respect of the property in dispute; but subject to the result of such suit, if any,
the order shall be conclusive.
    85. Release, sale and restoration of attached property.—(1) If the proclaimed person appears
within the time specified in the proclamation, the Court shall make an order releasing the property from
the attachment.
    (2) If the proclaimed person does not appear within the time specified in the proclamation, the
property under the attachment shall be at the disposal of the State Government; but it shall not be sold
until the expiration of six months from the date of the attachment and until any claim preferred or
objection made under section 84 has been disposed of under that section, unless it is subject to speedy and
natural decay, or the Court considers that the sale would be for the benefit of the owner; in either of which
cases the Court may cause it to be sold whenever it thinks fit.
    (3) If, within two years from the date of the attachment, any person whose property is or has been at
the disposal of the State Government, under sub-section (2), appears voluntarily or is apprehended and
brought before the Court by whose order the property was attached, or the Court to which such Court is
subordinate, and proves to the satisfaction of such Court that he did not abscond or conceal himself for
the purpose of avoiding execution of the warrant, and that he had not such notice of the proclamation as to
enable him to attend within the time specified therein, such property, or, if the same has been sold, the
net proceeds of the sale, or, if part only thereof has been sold, the net proceeds of the sale and the residue
of the property, shall, after satisfying therefrom all costs incurred in consequence of the attachment, be
delivered to him.
    86. Appeal from order rejecting application for restoration of attached property.—Any person
referred to in sub-section (3) of section 85, who is aggrieved by any refusal to deliver property or the
proceeds of the sale thereof may appeal to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of
the first-mentioned Court.
                                    D.—Other rules regarding processes
    87. Issue of warrant in lieu of, or in addition to, summons.—A Court may, in any case in which it
is empowered by this Code to issue a summons for the appearance of any person, issue, after recording its
reasons in writing, a warrant for his arrest—
        (a) if, either before the issue of such summons, or after the issue of the same but before the time
    fixed for his appearance, the Court sees reason to believe that he has absconded or will not obey the
    summons; or

                                                      51
        (b) if at such time he fails to appear and the summons is proved to have been duly served in time
    to admit of his appearing in accordance therewith and no reasonable excuse is offered for such failure.
    88. Power to take bond for appearance.—When any person for whose appearance or arrest the
officer presiding in any Court is empowered to issue a summons or warrant, is present in such Court, such
officer may require such person to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for his appearance in such
Court, or any other Court to which the case may be transferred for trial.
   89. Arrest on breach of bond for appearance.—When any person who is bound by any bond taken
under this Code to appear before a Court, does not appear, the officer presiding in such Court may issue a
warrant directing that such person be arrested and produced before him.
    90. Provisions of this Chapter generally applicable to summonses and warrants of arrest.—The
provisions contained in this Chapter relating to a summons and warrant, and their issue, service and
execution, shall, so far as may be, apply to every summons and every warrant of arrest issued under this
Code.
                                                 CHAPTER VII
                        PROCESSES TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF THINGS
                                            A.—Summons to produce
    91. Summons to produce document or other thing.—(1) Whenever any Court or any officer in
charge of a police station considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or
desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code by or
before such Court or officer, such Court may issue a summons, or such officer a written order, to the
person in whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend
and produce it, or to produce it, at the time and place stated in the summons or order.
    (2) Any person required under this section merely to produce a document or other thing shall be
deemed to have complied with the requisition if he causes such document or thing to be produced instead
of attending personally to produce the same.
    (3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed—
       (a) to affect sections 123 and 124 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), or the Bankers’
    Books Evidence Act, 1891 (13 of 1891), or
         (b) to apply to a letter, postcard, telegram or other document or any parcel or thing in the custody
    of the postal or telegraph authority.
     92. Procedure as to letters and telegrams.—(1) If any document, parcel or thing in the custody of a
postal or telegraph authority is, in the opinion of the District Magistrate, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court
of Session or High Court wanted for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding
under this Code, such Magistrate or Court may require the postal or telegraph authority, as the case may
be, to deliver the document, parcel or thing to such person as the Magistrate or Court directs.
    (2) If any such document, parcel or thing is, in the opinion of any other Magistrate, whether
Executive or Judicial, or of any Commissioner of Police or District Superintendent of Police, wanted for
any such purpose, he may require the postal or telegraph authority, as the case may be, to cause search to
be made for and to detain such document, parcel or thing pending the order of a District Magistrate, Chief
Judicial Magistrate or Court under sub-section (1).
                                           B.—Search-warrants
    93. When search-warrant may be issued.—(1) (a) Where any Court has reason to believe that a
person to whom a summons order under section 91 or a requisition under sub-section (1) of section 92 has

                                                     52
been, or might be, addressed, will not or would not produce the document or thing as required by such
summons or requisition, or
    (b) where such document or thing is not known to the Court to be in the possession of any person, or
      (c) where the Court considers that the purposes of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this
Code will be served by a general search or inspection, it may issue a search-warrant; and the person to
whom such warrant is directed, may search or inspect in accordance therewith and the provisions
hereinafter contained.
     (2) The Court may, if it thinks fit, specify in the warrant the particular place or part thereof to which
only the search or inspection shall extend; and the person charged with the execution of such warrant
shall then search or inspect only the place or part so specified.
     (3) Nothing contained in this section shall authorise any Magistrate other than a District Magistrate or
Chief Judicial Magistrate to grant a warrant to search for a document, parcel or other thing in the custody
of the postal or telegraph authority.
     94. Search of place suspected to contain stolen property, forged documents, etc.—(1) If a District
Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class, upon information and after such
inquiry as he thinks necessary, has reason to believe that any place is used for the deposit or sale of stolen
property, or for the deposit, sale or production of any objectionable article to which this section applies, or
that any such objectionable article is deposited in any place, he may by warrant authorise any police
officer above the rank of a constable—
          (a) to enter, with such assistance as may be required, such place,
          (b) to search the same in the manner specified in the warrant,
          (c) to take possession of any property or article therein found which he reasonably suspects to be
     stolen property or objectionable article to which this section applies,
          (d) to convey such property or article before a Magistrate, or to guard the same on the spot until
     the offender is taken before a Magistrate, or otherwise to dispose of it in some place of safety,
          (e) to take into custody and carry before a Magistrate every person found in such place who
     appears to have been privy to the deposit, sale or production of any such property or article knowing
     or having reasonable cause to suspect it to be stolen property or, as the case may be, objectionable
     article to which this section applies.
     (2) The objectionable articles to which this section applies are—
          (a) counterfeit coin;
          (b) pieces of metal made in contravention of the Metal Tokens Act, 1889 (1 of 1889), or brought
     into India in contravention of any notification for the time being in force under section 11 of the
     Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962);
          (c) counterfeit currency note; counterfeit stamps;
          (d) forged documents;
          (e) false seals;
          (f) obscene objects referred to in section 292 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860);
          (g) instruments or materials used for the production of any of the articles mentioned in clauses (a)
     to (f).
     95. Power to declare certain publications forfeited and to issue search-warrants for the
same.—(1) Where—
          (a) any newspaper, or book, or
          (b) any document,
wherever printed, appears to the State Government to contain any matter the publication of which is
                                                        53
punishable under section 124A or section 153A or section 153B or section 292 or section 293 or section
295A of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the State Government may, by notification, stating the
grounds of its opinion, declare every copy of the issue of the newspaper containing such matter,
and every copy of such book or other document to be forfeited to Government, and thereupon any
police officer may seize the same wherever found in India and any Magistrate may by warrant authorise
any police officer not below the rank of sub-inspector to enter upon and search for the same in any
premises where any copy of such issue, or any such book or other document may be or may be reasonably
suspected to be.
    (2) In this section and in section 96,—
         (a) “newspaper” and “book” have the same meaning as in the Press and Registration of Books
    Act, 1867 (25 of 1867);
         (b) “document” includes any painting, drawing or photograph, or other visible representation.
    (3) No order passed or action taken under this section shall be called in question in any Court
otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of section 96.
    96. Application to High Court to set aside declaration of forfeiture.—(1) Any person having any
interest in any newspaper, book or other document, in respect of which a declaration of forfeiture has
been made under section 95, may, within two months from the date of publication in the Official Gazette
of such declaration, apply to the High Court to set aside such declaration on the ground that the issue of
the newspaper, or the book or other document, in respect of which the declaration was made, did not
contain any such matter as is referred to in sub-section (1) of section 95.
    (2) Every such application shall, where the High Court consists of three or more Judges, be heard and
determined by a Special Bench of the High Court composed of three Judges and where the High Court
consists of less than three Judges, such Special Bench shall be composed of all the Judges of that High
Court.
    (3) On the hearing of any such application with reference to any newspaper, any copy of such
newspaper may be given in evidence in aid of the proof of the nature or tendency of the words, signs or
visible representations contained in such newspaper, in respect of which the declaration of forfeiture was
made.
    (4) The High Court shall, if it is not satisfied that the issue of the newspaper, or the book or other
document, in respect of which the application has been made, contained any such matter as is referred to
in sub-section (1) of section 95, set aside the declaration of forfeiture.
    (5) Where there is a difference of opinion among the Judges forming the Special Bench, the decision
shall be in accordance with the opinion of the majority of those Judges.
    97. Search for persons wrongfully confined.—If any District Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate
or Magistrate of the first class has reason to believe that any person is confined under such circumstances
that the confinement amounts to an offence, he may issue a search-warrant, and the person to whom such
warrant is directed may search for the person so confined; and such search shall be made in accordance
therewith, and the person, if found, shall be immediately taken before a Magistrate, who shall make such
order as in the circumstances of the case seems proper.
    98. Power to compel restoration of abducted females.—Upon complaint made on oath of the
abduction or unlawful detention of a woman, or a female child under the age of eighteen years for any
unlawful purpose, a District Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class may
make an order for the immediate restoration of such woman to her liberty, or of such female child to her
husband, parent, guardian or other person having the lawful charge of such child, and may compel
compliance with such order, using such force as may be necessary.
                                 C.—General provisions relating to searches
    99. Direction, etc., of search-warrants.—The provisions of sections 38, 70, 72, 74, 77, 78 and 79
shall, so far as may be, apply to all search-warrants issued under section 93, section 94, section 95 or
                                                    54
section 97.
    100. Persons in charge of closed place to allow search.—(1) Whenever any place liable to search or
inspection under this Chapter is closed, any person residing in, or being in charge of, such place, shall, on
demand of the officer or other person executing the warrant, and on production of the warrant, allow him
free ingress thereto, and afford all reasonable facilities for a search therein.
    (2) If ingress into such place cannot be so obtained, the officer or other person executing the warrant
may proceed in the manner provided by sub-section (2) of section 47.
   (3) Where any person in or about such place is reasonably suspected of concealing about his person
any article for which search should be made, such person may be searched and if such person is a
woman, the search shall be made by another woman with strict regard to decency.
    (4) Before making a search under this Chapter, the officer or other person about to make it shall call
upon two or more independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be
searched is situate or of any other locality if no such inhabitant of the said locality is available or is
willing to be a witness to the search, to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to

Court, Judge or Magistrate through such authority, as the Central Government may, by notification, specify in this

of attachment or forfeiture of such property, as it may deem fit under the provisions of sections 105D to
105J (both inclusive).
     (2) Where the Court has made an order for attachment or forfeiture of any property under sub-section

law for the time being in force.

    105D. Identifying unlawfully acquired property.—(1) The Court shall, under sub-section (1), or on

     (2) The steps referred to in sub-section (1) may include any inquiry, investigation or survey in respect
of any person, place, property, assets, documents, books of account in any bank or public financial

mentioned in sub-section (1) in accordance with such directions issued by the said Court in this behalf.

    105E. Seizure or attachment of property.—(1) Where any officer conducting an inquiry or
investigation under section 105D has a reason to believe that any property in relation to which such
inquiry or investigation is being conducted is likely to be concealed transferred or dealt with in any
manner which will result in disposal of such property, he may make an order for seizing such property
and where it is not practicable to seize such property, he may make an order of attachment directing that
such property shall not be transferred or otherwise dealt with, except with the prior permission of the
officer making such order, and a copy of such order shall be served on the person concerned.

    (2) Any order made under sub-section (1) shall have no effect unless the said order is confirmed by an
order of the said Court, within a period of thirty days of its being made.

    (2) The Administrator appointed under sub-section (1) shall receive and manage the property in
relation to which the order has been made under sub-section (1) of section 105E or under section 105H in

    (3) The Administrator shall also take such measures, as the Central Government may direct, to
dispose of the property which is forfeited to the Central Government.

    105G. Notice of forfeiture of property.—(1) If as a result of the inquiry, investigation or survey
under section 105D, the Court has reason to believe that all or any of such properties are proceeds of
crime, it may serve a notice upon such person (hereinafter referred to as the person affected) calling upon
him within a period of thirty days specified in the notice to indicate the source of income, earnings or
assets, out of which or by means of which he has acquired such property, the evidence on which he relies
and other relevant information and particulars, and to show cause why all or any of such properties, as the
case may be, should not be declared to be proceeds of crime and forfeited to the Central Government.

    (2) Where a notice under sub-section (1) to any person specifies any property as being held on behalf
of such person by any other person, a copy of the notice shall also be served upon such other person.

    105H. Forfeiture of property in certain cases.—(1) The Court may, after considering the
explanation, if any, to the show-cause notice issued under section 105G and the material available
before it and after giving to the person affected (and in a case where the person affected holds any
property specified in the notice through any other person, to such other person also) a reasonable
opportunity of being heard, by order, record a finding whether all or any of the properties in question
are proceeds of crime:
    Provided that if the person affected (and in a case where the person affected holds any property
specified in the notice through any other person such other person also) does not appear before the
Court or represent his case before it within a period of thirty days specified in the show -cause notice,
the Court may proceed to record a finding under this sub-section ex parte on the basis of evidence
available before it.
    (2) Where the Court is satisfied that some of the properties referred to in the show -cause notice
are proceeds of crime but it is not possible to identify specifically such properties, then, it shall be
lawful for the Court to specify the properties which, to the best of its judgment, are proceeds of crime
and record a finding accordingly under sub-section (1).
    (3) Where the Court records a finding under this section to the effect that any property is
proceeds of crime, such property shall stand forfeited to the Central Government free from all
encumbrances.
    (4) Where any shares in a company stand forfeited to the Central Government under this section,
then, the company shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956)
or the articles of association of the company, forthwith register the Central Government as the
transferee of such shares.
    105-I. Fine in lieu of forfeiture.—(1) Where the Court makes a declaration that any property
stands forfeited to the Central Government under section 105H and it is a case where the source of
only a part of such property has not been proved to the satisfaction of the Court, it shall make an
order giving an option to the person affected to pay, in lieu of forfeiture, a fine equal to the market
value of such part.
    (2) Before making an order imposing a fine under sub-section (1), the person affected shall be
given a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
    (3) Where the person affected pays the fine due under sub-section (1), within such time as may
be allowed in that behalf, the Court may, by order, revoke the declaration of forfeiture under section
105H and thereupon such property shall stand released.

    105J. Certain transfers to be null and void.—Where after the making of an order under sub-
section (1) of section 105E or the issue of a notice under section 105G, any property referred to in the
said order or notice is transferred by any mode whatsoever such transfers shall, for the purposes of
the proceedings under this Chapter, be ignored and if such property is subsequently forfeited to the
Central Government under section 105H, then, the transfer of such property shall be deemed to be
null and void.
    105K. Procedure in respect of letter of request.—Every letter of request, summons or warrant,
received by the Central Government from, and every letter of request, summons or warrant, to be
transmitted to a contracting State under this Chapter shall be transmitted to a contracting State or, as
the case may be, sent to the concerned Court in India in such form and in such manner as the Central
Government may, by notification, specify in this behalf.
    105L. Application of this Chapter.—The Central Government may, by notification in the
Official Gazette, direct that the application of this Chapter in relation to a contracting State with
which reciprocal arrangements have been made, shall be subject to such conditions, exceptions or

time of passing sentence on such person, order him to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace
for such period, not exceeding three years, as it thinks fit.

that may probably occasion a breach of the peace or disturb the public tranquillity and is of opinion that there is
sufficient ground for proceeding, he may, in the manner hereinafter provided, require such person to show cause
why he should not be ordered to execute a bond 1[with or without sureties,] for keeping the peace for such period,
not exceeding one year, as the Magistrate thinks fit.

              (ii) any offence punishable under any other law providing for the prevention of hoarding or
          profiteering or of adulteration of food or drugs or of corruption, or

          (g) is so desperate and dangerous to render his being at large without security hazardous to the community,

such Magistrate may, in the manner hereinafter provided, require such person to show cause why he should not be
ordered to execute a bond, with sureties, for his good behaviour for such period, not exceeding three years, as the
Magistrate thinks fit.
     111. Order to be made.—When a Magistrate acting under section 107, section 108, section 109 or section 110,
deems it necessary to require any person to show cause under such section, he shall make an order in writing, setting
forth the substance of the information received, the amount of the bond to be executed, the term for which it is to be
in force, and the number, character and class of sureties (if any) required.

     112. Procedure in respect of person present in Court.—If the person in respect of whom such order is made
is present in Court, it shall be read over to him, or, if he so desires, the substance thereof shall be explained to him.

     113. Summons or warrant in case of person not so present.—If such person is not present in Court, the
Magistrate shall issue a summons requiring him to appear, or, when such person is in custody, a warrant directing
the officer in whose custody he is to bring him before the Court:

     Provided that whenever it appears to such Magistrate, upon the report of a police officer or upon other
information (the substance of which report or information shall be recorded by the Magistrate), that there is reason
to fear the commission of a breach of the peace, and that such breach of the peace cannot be prevented otherwise
than by the immediate arrest of such person, the Magistrate may at any time issue a warrant for his arrest.

     114. Copy of order to accompany summons or warrant.—Every summons or warrant issued under section
113 shall be accompanied by a copy of the order made under section 111, and such copy shall be delivered by the
officer serving or executing such summons or warrant to the person served with, or arrested under, the same.

    115. Power to dispense with personal attendance.—The Magistrate may, if he sees sufficient cause, dispense
with the personal attendance of any person called upon to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a
bond for keeping the peace or for good behaviour and may permit him to appear by a pleader.

     116. Inquiry as to truth of information.—(1) When an order under section 111 has been read or explained
under section 112 to a person present in Court, or when any person appears or is brought before a Magistrate in
compliance with, or in execution of, a summons or warrant, issued under section 113, the Magistrate shall proceed
to inquire into the truth of the information upon which action has been taken, and to take such further evidence as
may appear necessary.

    (2) Such inquiry shall be made, as nearly as may be practicable, in the manner hereinafter prescribed for
conducting trial and recording evidence in summons-cases.

     (3) After the commencement, and before the completion, of the inquiry under sub-section (1), the Magistrate,
if he considers that immediate measures are necessary for the prevention of a breach of the peace or disturbance
of the public tranquillity or the commission of any offence or for the public safety, may, for reasons to be
recorded in writing, direct the person in respect of whom the order under section 111 has been made to execute a
bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace or maintaining good behaviour until the conclusion of the
inquiry, and may detain him in custody until such bond is executed or, in default of execution, until the inquiry is
concluded:

    Provided that—

         (a) no person against whom proceedings are not being taken under section 108, section 109, or section 110
    shall be directed to execute a bond for maintaining good behaviour;

        (b) the conditions of such bond, whether as to the amount thereof or as to the provision of sureties or the
    number thereof or the pecuniary extent of their liability, shall not be more onerous than those specified in the
    order under section 111.

     (4) For the purposes of this section the fact that a person is an habitual offender or is so desperate and dangerous
as to render his being at large without security hazardous to the community may be proved by evidence of general
repute or otherwise.

    (5) Where two or more persons have been associated together in the matter under inquiry, they may be dealt
within the same or separate inquiries as the Magistrate shall think just.

     (6) The inquiry under this section shall be completed within a period of six months from the date of its
commencement, and if such inquiry is not so completed, the proceedings under this Chapter shall, on the expiry of
the said period, stand terminated unless, for special reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise
directs:
    Provided that where any person has been kept in detention pending such inquiry, the proceeding against that
person, unless terminated earlier, shall stand terminated on the expiry of a period of six months of such detention.
     (7) Where any direction is made under sub-section (6) permitting the continuance of proceedings the Sessions
Judge may, on an application made to him by the aggrieved party, vacate such direction if he is satisfied that it was
not based on any special reason or was perverse.
    117. Order to give security.—If, upon such inquiry, it is proved that it is necessary for keeping the peace or
maintaining good behaviour, as the case may be, that the person in respect of whom the inquiry is made should
execute a bond, with or without sureties, the Magistrate shall make an order accordingly:
    Provided that—
        (a) no person shall be ordered to give security of a nature different from, or of an amount larger than, or for
    a period longer than, that specified in the order made under section 111;
        (b) the amount of every bond shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and shall not
    be excessive;
         (c) when the person in respect of whom the inquiry is made is a minor, the bond shall be executed only by
    his sureties.
    118. Discharge of person informed against.—If, on an inquiry under section 116, it is not proved that it is
necessary for keeping the peace or maintaining good behaviour, as the case may be, that the person in respect of
whom the inquiry is made, should execute a bond, the Magistrate shall make an entry on the record to that effect,
and if such person is in custody only for the purposes of the inquiry, shall release him, or, if such person is not in
custody, shall discharge him.

                                                           63
    119. Commencement of period for which security is required.—(1) If any person, in respect of whom an
order requiring security is made under section 106 or section 117, is at the time such order is made, sentenced to, or
undergoing a sentence of, imprisonment, the period for which such security is required shall commence on the
expiration of such sentence.
    (2) In other cases such period shall commence on the date of such order unless the Magistrate, for sufficient
reason, fixes a later date.
     120. Contents of bond.—The bond to be executed by any such person shall bind him to keep the peace or to be
of good behaviour, as the case may be, and in the latter case the commission or attempt to commit, or the abetment
of, any offence punishable with imprisonment, wherever it may be committed, is a breach of the bond.
     121. Power to reject sureties.—(1) A Magistrate may refuse to accept any surety offered, or may reject any
surety previously accepted by him or his predecessor under this Chapter on the ground that such surety is an unfit
person for the purposes of the bond:
    Provided that, before so refusing to accept or rejecting any such surety, he shall either himself hold an inquiry
on oath into the fitness of the surety, or cause such inquiry to be held and a report to be made thereon by a
Magistrate subordinate to him.
     (2) Such Magistrate shall, before holding the inquiry, give reasonable notice to the surety and to the person by
whom the surety was offered and shall, in making the inquiry, record the substance of the evidence adduced before
him.
     (3) If the Magistrate is satisfied, after considering the evidence so adduced either before him or before a
Magistrate deputed under sub-section (1), and the report of such Magistrate (if any), that the surety is an unfit person
for the purposes of the bond, he shall make an order refusing to accept or rejecting, as the case may be, such surety
and recording his reasons for so doing:

     Provided that, before making an order rejecting any surety who has previously been accepted, the Magistrate
shall issue his summons or warrant, as he thinks fit, and cause the person for whom the surety is bound to appear or
to be brought before him.
     122. Imprisonment in default of security.—(1) (a) If any person ordered to give security under section 106 or
section 117 does not give such security on or before the date on which the period for which such security is to be
given commences, he shall, except in the case next hereinafter mentioned, be committed to prison, or, if he is
already in prison, be detained in prison until such period expires or until within such period he gives the security to
the Court or Magistrate who made the order requiring it.
    (b) If any person after having executed a 1[bond, with or without sureties] without sureties for keeping the peace
in pursuance of an order of a Magistrate under section 117, is proved, to the satisfaction of such Magistrate or his
successor-in-office, to have committed breach of the bond, such Magistrate or successor-in-office may, after
recording the grounds of such proof, order that the person be arrested and detained in prison until the expiry of the
period of the bond and such order shall be without prejudice to any other punishment or forfeiture to which the said
person may be liable in accordance with law.
     (2) When such person has been ordered by a Magistrate to give security for a period exceeding one year, such
Magistrate shall, if such person does not give such security as aforesaid, issue a warrant directing him to be detained
in prison pending the orders of the Sessions Judge and the proceedings shall be laid, as soon as conveniently may be,
before such Court.
    (3) Such Court, after examining such proceedings and requiring from the Magistrate any further information or
evidence which it thinks necessary, and after giving the concerned person a reasonable opportunity of being heard,
may pass such order on the case as it thinks fit:
     Provided that the period (if any) for which any person is imprisoned for failure to give security shall not exceed


1. Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 15, for “bond without sureties” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).
                                                                64
three years.
    (4) If security has been required in the course of the same proceeding from two or more persons in respect
of any one of whom the proceedings are referred to the Sessions Judge under sub-section (2) such reference shall
also include the case of any other of such persons who has been order to give security, and the provisions of
sub-sections (2) and (3) shall, in that event, apply to the case of such other person also, except that the period (if
any) for which he may be imprisoned, shall not exceed the period for which he was ordered to give security.
    (5) A Sessions Judge may in his discretion transfer any proceedings laid before him under sub-section (2) or
sub-section (4) to an Additional Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge and upon such transfer, such Additional
Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge may exercise the powers of a Sessions Judge under this section in
respect of such proceedings.
    (6) If the security is tendered to the officer in charge of the jail, he shall forthwith refer the matter to the Court
or Magistrate who made the order, and shall await the orders of such Court or Magistrate.
     (7) Imprisonment for failure to give security for keeping the peace shall be simple.
     (8) Imprisonment for failure to give security for good behaviour shall, where the proceedings have been taken
under section 108, be simple, and, where the proceedings have been taken under section 109 or section 110, be
rigorous or simple as the Court or Magistrate in each case directs.
    123. Power to release persons imprisoned for failing to give security.—(1) Whenever 1[the District
Magistrate in the case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial
Magistrate in any other case] is of opinion that any person imprisoned for failing to give security under this Chapter
may be released without hazard to the community or to any other person, he may order such person to be
discharged.
    (2) Whenever any person has been imprisoned for failing to give security under this Chapter, the High Court or
Court of Session, or, where the order was made by any other Court, 2[District Magistrate, in the case of an order
passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other case], may make
an order reducing the amount of the security or the number of sureties or the time for which security has been
required.

    (3) An order under sub-section (1) may direct the discharge of such person either without conditions or upon
any conditions which such person accepts:

    Provided that any condition imposed shall cease to be operative when the period for which such person was
ordered to give security has expired.

     (4) The State Government may prescribe the conditions upon which a conditional discharge may be made.

    (5) If any condition upon which any person has been discharged is, in the opinion of 2[District Magistrate, in the
case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other
case] by whom the order of discharge was made or of his successor, not fulfilled, he may cancel the same.

     (6) When a conditional order of discharge has been cancelled under sub-section (5), such person may be
arrested by any police officer without warrant, and shall thereupon be produced before the 3[District Magistrate, in
the case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any
other case].

     (7) Unless such person gives security in accordance with the terms of the original order for the unexpired
portion of the term for which he was in the first instance committed or ordered to be detained (such portion being
deemed to be a period equal to the period between the date of the breach of the conditions of discharge and the date
on which, except for such conditional discharge, he would have been entitled to release), 1[District Magistrate, in the

1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 12, for “the Chief Judicial Magistrate” (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).

case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other
case] may remand such person to prison to undergo such unexpired portion.

     (8) A person remanded to prison under sub-section (7) shall, subject to the provisions of section 122, be
released at any time on giving security in accordance with the terms of the original order for the unexpired portion
aforesaid to the Court or Magistrate by whom such order was made, or to its or his successor.

     (9) The High Court or Court of Session may at any time, for sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing, cancel
any bond for keeping the peace or for good behaviour executed under this Chapter by any order made by it, and
1
  [District Magistrate, in the case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief
Judicial Magistrate in any other case] may make such cancellation where such bond was executed under his order or
under the order of any other Court in his district.

     (10) Any surety for the peaceable conduct or good behaviour of another person ordered to execute a bond under
this Chapter may at any time apply to the Court making such order to cancel the bond and on such application being
made, the Court shall issue a summons or warrant, as it thinks fit, requiring the person for whom such surety is bond
appear or to be brought before it.

     124. Security for unexpired period of bond.—(1) When a person for whose appearance a summons or warrant
has been issued under the proviso to sub-section (3) of section 121 or under sub-section (10) of section 123, appears
or is brought before the Magistrate or Court, the Magistrate or Court shall cancel the bond executed by such person
and shall order such person to give, for the unexpired portion of the term of such bond, fresh security of the same
description as the original security.

   (2) Every such order shall, for the purposes of sections 120 to 123 (both inclusive) be deemed to be an order
made under section 106 or section 117, as the case may be.

                                                      CHAPTER IX
                         ORDER FOR MAINTENANCE OF WIVES, CHILDREN AND PARENTS
    125. Order for maintenance of wives, children and parents.—(1) If any person having sufficient means
neglects or refuses to maintain—

         (a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or

         (b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to maintain itself, or

         (c) his legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority, where such
    child is, by reason of any physical or mental abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or

         (d) his father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself,

a Magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly
allowance for the maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, at such monthly rate 1*** as such
Magistrate thinks fit and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct:

    Provided that the Magistrate may order the father of a minor female child referred to in clause (b) to make such
allowance, until she attains her majority, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the husband of such minor female child, if
married, is not possessed of sufficient means:
    2
     [Provided further that the Magistrate may, during the pendency of the proceeding regarding monthly allowance
for the maintenance under this sub-section, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the interim
maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, and the expenses of such proceeding which the Magistrate
considers reasonable, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct:


1. Certain words omitted by Act 50 of 2001, s. 2 (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).
2. Ins. by s. 2, ibid. (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).

     Provided also that an application for the monthly allowance for the interim maintenance and expenses of
proceeding under the second proviso shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of the
service of notice of the application to such person.]

        Explanation.—For the purposes of this Chapter,—

            (a) “minor” means a person who, under the provisions of the Indian Majority Act, 1875 (9 of 1875) is
        deemed not to have attained his majority;

            (b) “wife” includes a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and
        has not remarried.
    1
    [(2) Any such allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding shall be
payable from the date of the order, or, if so ordered, from the date of the application for maintenance or interim
maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be.]

    (3) If any person so ordered fails without sufficient cause to comply with the order, any such Magistrate may, for
every breach of the order, issue a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines, and
may sentence such person, for the whole or any part of each month’s 2[allowance for the maintenance or the interim
maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] remaining unpaid after the execution of the warrant,
to imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or until payment if sooner made:

   Provided that no warrant shall be issued for the recovery of any amount due under this section unless application
be made to the Court to levy such amount within a period of one year from the date on which it became due:

     Provided further that if such person offers to maintain his wife on condition of her living with him, and she
refuses to live with him, such Magistrate may consider any grounds of refusal stated by her, and may make an order
under this section notwithstanding such offer, if he is satisfied that there is just ground for so doing.

    Explanation.—If a husband has contracted marriage with another woman or keeps a mistress, it shall be
considered to be just ground for his wife’s refusal to live with him.

    (4) No wife shall be entitled to receive an 3[allowance for the maintenance or the interim maintenance and
expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if,
without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual
consent.

     (5) On proof that any wife in whose favour an order has been made under this section in living in adultery, or
that without sufficient reason she refuses to live with her husband, or that they are living separately by mutual
consent.

application made within three months from the date thereof subject to such terms including terms as to payment of
costs to the opposite party as the Magistrate may think just and proper.

   (3) The Court in dealing with applications under section 125 shall have power to make such order as to costs as
may be just.

section 125 a monthly allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance, or ordered under the same section to
pay a monthly allowance for the maintenance, or interim maintenance, to his wife, child, father or mother, as the
case may be, the Magistrate may make such alteration, as he thinks fit, in the allowance for the maintenance or the
interim maintenance, as the case may be.]

     (2) Where it appears to the Magistrate that, in consequence of any decision of a competent Civil Court, any
order made under section 125 should be cancelled or varied, he shall cancel the order or, as the case may be, vary
the same accordingly.

    (3) Where any order has been made under section 125 in favour of a woman who has been divorced by, or has
obtained a divorce from, her husband, the Magistrate shall, if he is satisfied that—

         (a) the woman has, after the date of such divorce, remarried, cancel such order as from the date of her
     remarriage;
          (b) the woman has been divorced by her husband and that she has received, whether before or after the date
     of the said order, the whole of the sum which, under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties,
     was payable on such divorce, cancel such order,—
               (i) in the case where such sum was paid before such order, from the date on which such order was
            made;
                (ii) in any other case, from the date of expiry of the period, if any, for which maintenance has been

                                                        CHAPTER X
                            MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ORDER AND TRANQUILLITY

                                                 A.—Unlawful assemblies
     129. Dispersal of assembly by use of civil force.—(1) Any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a
police station or, in the absence of such officer in charge, any police officer, not below the rank of a sub-inspector,
may command any unlawful assembly, or any assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the
public peace, to disperse; and it shall thereupon be the duty of the members of such assembly to disperse
accordingly.

     (2) If, upon being so commanded, any such assembly does not disperse, or if, without being so commanded, it
conducts itself in such a manner as to show a determination not to disperse, any Executive Magistrate or police
officer referred to in sub-section (1), may proceed to disperse such assembly by force, and may require the
assistance of any male person, not being an officer or member of the armed forces and acting as such, for the
purpose of dispersing such assembly, and, if necessary, arresting and confining the persons who form part of it, in


1. Subs. by Act 50 of 2001, s. 3, for “monthly allowance in pursuance of” (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).
2. Subs. by s. 4, ibid., for “maintenance” (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).
3. Subs. by s. 4, ibid., for “whom the allowance” (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).
4. Subs. by s. 4, ibid., for “allowance due” (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).

                                                               70
order to disperse such assembly or that they may be punished according to law.

      130. Use of armed forces to disperse assembly.—(1) If any such assembly cannot be otherwise dispersed, and
if it is necessary for the public security that it should be dispersed, the Executive Magistrate of the highest rank who
is present may cause it to be dispersed by the armed forces.

    (2) Such Magistrate may require any officer in command of any group of persons belonging to the armed forces
to disperse the assembly with the help of the armed forces under his command, and to arrest and confine such
persons forming part of it as the Magistrate may direct, or as it may be necessary to arrest and confine in order to
disperse the assembly or to have them punished according to law.

     (3) Every such officer of the armed forces shall obey such requisition in such manner as he thinks fit, but in so
doing he shall use as little force, and do as little injury to person and property, as may be consistent with dispersing
the assembly and arresting and detaining such persons.

    131. Power of certain armed force officers to disperse assembly.—When the public security is manifestly
endangered by any such assembly and no Executive Magistrate can be communicated with, any commissioned or
gazetted officer of the armed forces may disperse such assembly with the help of the armed forces under his
command, and may arrest and confine any persons forming part of it, in order to disperse such assembly or that they
may be punished according to law; but if, while he is acting under this section, it becomes practicable for him to
communicate with an Executive Magistrate, he shall do so, and shall thenceforward obey the instructions of the
Magistrate, as to whether he shall or shall not continue such action.

    132. Protection against prosecution for acts done under preceding sections.—(1) No prosecution against
any person for any act purporting to be done under section 129, section 130 or section 131 shall be instituted in any
Criminal Court except—

        (a) with the sanction of the Central Government where such person is an officer or member of the armed
    forces;

         (b) with the sanction of the State Government in any other case.

    (2) (a) No Executive Magistrate or police officer acting under any of the said sections in good faith;

    (b) no person doing any act in good faith in compliance with a requisition under section 129 or section 130;

    (c) no officer of the armed forces acting under section 131 in good faith;

    (d) no member of the armed forces doing any act in obedience to any order which he was bound to obey,

shall be deemed to have thereby committed an offence.

    (3) In this section and in the preceding sections of this Chapter,—

         (a) the expression “armed forces” means the military, naval and air forces, operating as land forces and
    includes any other armed forces of the Union so operating;

        (b) “officer”, in relation to the armed forces, means a person commissioned, gazetted or in pay as an officer
    of the armed forces and includes a junior commissioned officer, a warrant officer, a petty officer, a non-
    commissioned officer and a non-gazetted officer;

         (c) “member”, in relation to the armed forces, means a person in the armed forces other than an officer.

                                                   B.—Public nuisances
    133. Conditional order for removal of nuisance.—(1) Whenever a District Magistrate or a Sub-divisional
Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially empowered in this behalf by the State Government, on
receiving the report of a police officer or other information and on taking such evidence (if any) as he thinks fit,
considers—

         (a) that any unlawful obstruction or nuisance should be removed from any public place or from any way,
    river or channel which is or may be lawfully used by the public; or

         (b) that the conduct of any trade or occupation, or the keeping of any goods or merchandise, is injurious to
    the health or physical comfort of the community, and that in consequence such trade or occupation should be
    prohibited or regulated or such goods or merchandise should be removed or the keeping thereof regulated; or

        (c) that the construction of any building, or, the disposal of any substance, as is likely to occasion
    configuration or explosion, should be prevented or stopped; or

         (d) that any building, tent or structure, or any tree is in such a condition that it is likely to fall and thereby
    cause injury to persons living or carrying on business in the neighbourhood or passing by, and that in
    consequence the removal, repair or support of such building, tent or structure, or the removal or support of such
    tree, is necessary; or

       (e) that any tank, well or excavation adjacent to any such way or public place should be fenced in such
    manner as to prevent danger arising to the public; or

         (f) that any dangerous animal should be destroyed, confined or otherwise disposed of,

such Magistrate may make a conditional order requiring the person causing such obstruction or nuisance, or carrying
on such trade or occupation, or keeping any such goods or merchandise, or owning, possessing or controlling such
building, tent, structure, substance, tank, well or excavation, or owning or possessing such animal or tree, within a
time to be fixed in the order—

         (i) to remove such obstruction or nuisance; or

        (ii) to desist from carrying on, or to remove or regulate in such manner as may be directed, such trade or
    occupation, or to remove such goods or merchandise, or to regulate the keeping thereof in such manner as may
    be directed; or

         (iii) to prevent or stop the construction of such building, or to alter the disposal of such substance; or

         (iv) to remove, repair or support such building, tent or structure, or to remove or support such trees; or

         (v) to fence such tank, well or excavation; or

         (vi) to destroy, confine or dispose of such dangerous animal in the manner provided in the said order,

or, if he objects so to do, to appear before himself or some other Executive Magistrate subordinate to him at a time
and place to be fixed by the order, and show cause, in the manner hereinafter provided, why the order should not be
made absolute.

    (2) No order duly made by a Magistrate under this section shall be called in question in any Civil Court.

     Explanation.—A “public place” includes also property belonging to the State, camping grounds and grounds
left unoccupied for sanitary or recreative purposes.

   134. Service or notification of order.—(1) The order shall, if practicable, be served on the person against
whom it is made, in the manner herein provided for service of a summons.

    (2) If such order cannot be so served, it shall be notified by proclamation, published in such manner as the State
Government may, by rules, direct, and a copy thereof shall be struck up at such place or places as may be fittest for
conveying the information to such person.

   135. Person to whom order is addressed to obey or show cause.—The person against whom such order is
made shall—

         (a) perform, within the time and in the manner specified in the order, the act directed thereby; or

         (b) appear in accordance with such order and show cause against the same.

    136. Consequences of his failing to do so.—If such person does not perform such act or appear and show
cause, he shall be liable to the penalty prescribed in that behalf in section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),
and the order shall be made absolute.

    137. Procedure where existence of public right is denied.—(1) Where an order is made under section 133 for
the purpose of preventing obstruction, nuisance or danger to the public in the use of any way, river, channel or place,
the Magistrate shall, on the appearance before him of the person against whom the order was made, question him as
to whether he denies the existence of any public right in respect of the way, river, channel or place, and if he does
so, the Magistrate shall, before proceeding under section 138, inquire into the matter.

    (2) If in such inquiry the Magistrate finds that there is any reliable evidence in support of such denial, he shall
stay the proceedings until the matter of the existence of such right has been decided by a competent Court; and, if he
finds that there is no such evidence, he shall proceed as laid down in section 138.

    (3) A person who has, on being questioned by the Magistrate under sub-section (1), failed to deny the existence
of a public right of the nature therein referred to, or who, having made such denial, has failed to adduce reliable
evidence in support thereof, shall not in the subsequent proceedings be permitted to make any such denial.
   138. Procedure where he appears to show cause.—(1) If the person against whom an order under section 133
is made appears and shows cause against the order, the Magistrate shall take evidence in the matter as in a
summons-case.
   (2) If the Magistrate is satisfied that the order, either as originally made or subject to such modification as he
considers necessary, is reasonable and proper, the order shall be made absolute without modification or, as the case
may be, with such modification.
   (3) If the Magistrate is not so satisfied, no further proceedings shall be taken in the case.
   139. Power of Magistrate to direct local investigation and examination of an expert.—The Magistrate may,

   (2) The report of such person may be read as evidence in the case.
   (3) Where the Magistrate summons and examines an expert under section 139, the Magistrate may direct by
whom the costs of such summoning and examination shall be paid.
   141. Procedure on order being made absolute and consequences of disobedience.—(1) When an order has
been made absolute under section 136 or section 138, the Magistrate shall give notice of the same to the person
                                                           73
against whom the order was made, and shall further require him to perform the act directed by the order within a
time to be fixed in the notice, and inform him that, in case of disobedience, he will be liable to the penalty provided
by section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).
   (2) If such act is not performed within the time fixed, the Magistrate may cause it to be performed, and may
recover the costs of performing it, either by the sale of any building, goods or other property removed by his order,
or by the distress and sale of any other movable property of such person within or without such Magistrate’s local
jurisdiction, and if such other property is without such jurisdiction, the order shall authorise its attachment and sale
when endorsed by the Magistrate within whose local jurisdiction the property to be attached is found.
   (3) No suit shall lie in respect of anything done in good faith under this section.
    142. Injunction pending inquiry.—(1) If a Magistrate making an order under section 133 considers that
immediate measures should be taken to prevent imminent danger or injury of a serious kind to the public, he may
issue such an injunction to the person against whom the order was made, as is required to obviate or prevent
such danger or injury pending the determination of the matter.
    (2) In default of such person forthwith obeying such injunction, the Magistrate may himself use, or cause
to be used, such means as he thinks fit to obviate such danger or to prevent such injury.
    (3) No suit shall lie in respect of anything done in good faith by a Magistrate under this section.
    143. Magistrate may prohibit repetition or continuance of public nuisance .—A District Magistrate or
Sub-divisional Magistrate, or any other Executive Magistrate empowered by the State Government or the
District Magistrate in this behalf, may order any person not to repeat or continue a public nuisance, as defined

    144. Power to issue order in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger .—(1) In cases where, in
the opinion of a District Magistrate, a Sub-divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially
empowered by the State Government in this behalf, there is sufficient ground for proceeding under this section
and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable, such Magistrate may, by a written order stating the
material facts of the case and served in the manner provided by section 134, direct any person to abstain from a
certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession or under his management,
if such Magistrate considers that such direction is likely to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance
or injury to any person lawfully employed, or danger to human life, health o r safety or a disturbance of the
public tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray.
    (2) An order under this section may, in cases of emergency or in cases where the circumstances do not
admit of the serving in due time of a notice upon the person against whom the order is directed, be passed ex
parte.
    (3) An order under this section may be directed to a particular individual, or to persons residing in a
particular place or area, or to the public generally when frequenting or visiting a particular place or area.
    (4) No order under this section shall remain in force for more than two months from the making thereof:
    Provided that, if the State Government considers it necessary so to do for preventing danger to human life,
health or safety or for preventing a riot or any affray, it may, by notification, direct that an order made by a
Magistrate under this section shall remain in force for such further period not exceeding six months from the
date on which the order made by the Magistrate would have, but for such ord er, expired, as it may specify in
the said notification.
     (5) Any Magistrate may, either on his own motion or on the application of any person aggrieved, rescind
                                                           74

predecessor-in-office.
     (6) The State Government may, either on its own motion or on the application of any person aggrieved,
rescind or alter any order made by it under the proviso to sub -section (4).
     (7) Where an application under sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) is received, the Magistrate, or the State
Government, as the case may be, shall afford to the applicant an early opportunity of appearing before him or
it, either in person or by pleader and showing cause against the order; and if the Mag istrate or the State
Government, as the case may be, rejects the application wholly or in part, he or it shall record in writing the
reasons for so doing.

     [144A. Power to prohibit carrying arms in procession or mass drill or mass training with
arms.—(1) The District Magistrate may, whenever he considers it necessary so to do for the
preservation of public peace or public safety or for the maintenance of public order, by public notice
or by order, prohibit in any area within the local limits of his jurisdiction, the carrying of arms in any
procession or the organising or holding of, or taking part in, any mass drill or mass training with

person or to persons belonging to any community, party or organisation.
    (3) No public notice issued or an order made under this section shall remain in force for more
than three months from the date on which it is issued or made.
    (4) The State Government may, if it considers necessary so to do for the preservation of public
peace or public safety or for the maintenance of public order, by notification, direct that a public
notice issued or order made by the District Magistrate under this section shall remain in force for
such further period not exceeding six months from the date on which such public notice or order was
issued or made by the District Magistrate would have, but for such direction, expired, as it may
specify in the said notification.

impose, by general or special order, delegate its powers under sub-section (4) to the District

    145. Procedure where dispute concerning land or water is likely to cause breach of peace .—
(1) Whenever an Executive Magistrate is satisfied from a report of a police officer or upon other
information that a dispute likely to cause a breach of the peace exists concerning any land or water or
the boundaries thereof, within his local jurisdiction, he shall make an order in writing, stating the
grounds of his being so satisfied, and requiring the parties concerned in such dispute to attend his
Court in person or by pleader, on a specified date and time, and to put in written statements of their
respective claims as respects the fact of actual possession of the subject of dispute.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the expression “land or water” includes buildings, markets,
fisheries, crops or other produce of land, and the rents or profits of any such property.
    (3) A copy of the order shall be served in the manner provided by this Code for the service of a
summons upon such person or persons as the Magistrate may direct, and at least one copy shall be
published by being affixed to some conspicuous place at or near the subject of dispute.
    (4) The Magistrate shall then, without reference to the merits or the claims of any of the parties
to a right to possess the subject of dispute, persue the statements so put in, hear the parties, receive
all such evidence as may be produced by them, take such further evidence, if any, as he thinks
necessary, and, if possible, decide whether any and which of the parties was, at the date of the order
made by him under sub-section (1), in possession of the subject of dispute:
    Provided that if it appears to the Magistrate that any party has been forcibly and wrongfully
dispossessed within two months next before the date on which the report of a police officer or other

1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 16 (date yet to be notified, see appendix)
                                                                  75
information was received by the Magistrate, or after that date and before the date of his order under
sub-section (1), he may treat the party so dispossessed as if that party had been in possession on the
date of his order under sub-section (1).
    (5) Nothing in this section shall preclude any party so required to attend, or any other person
interested, from showing that no such dispute as aforesaid exists or has existed; and in such case the
Magistrate shall cancel his said order, and all further proceedings thereon shall be stayed, but, subject
to such cancellation, the order of the Magistrate under sub-section (1) shall be final.
    (6) (a) If the Magistrate decides that one of the parties was, or should under the proviso to sub -
section (4) be treated as being, in such possession of the said subject, he shall issue an order
declaring such party to be entitled to possession thereof until evicted therefrom in due course of law,
and forbidding all disturbance of such possession until such eviction; and when he proceeds under
the proviso to sub-section (4), may restore to possession the party forcibly and wrongfully
dispossessed.
    (b) The order made under this sub-section shall be served and published in the manner laid down
in sub-section (3).
    (7) When any party to any such proceeding dies, the Magistrate may cause the legal
representative of the deceased party to be made a party to the proceeding and shall thereupon
continue the inquiry, and if any question arises as to who the legal representative of a deceased party
for the purposes of such proceeding is, all persons claiming to be representatives of the deceased
party shall be made parties thereto.
    (8) If the Magistrate is of opinion that any crop or other produce of the property, the subject of dispute in a
proceeding under this section pending before him, is subject to speedy and natural decay, he may make an
order for the proper custody or sale of such property, and, upon the completion of the inquiry, shall make such
order for the disposal of such property, or the sale-proceeds thereof, as he thinks fit.
     (9) The Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, at any stage of the proceedings under this section, on the
application of either party, issue a summons to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any
document or thing.
     (10) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to be in derogation of powers of the Magistrate to
proceed under section 107.
     146. Power to attach subject of dispute and to appoint receiver.—(1) If the Magistrate at any time
after making the order under sub-section (1) of section 145 considers the case to be one of emergency, or
if he decides that none of the parties was then in such possession as is referred to in section 145, or if he is
unable to satisfy himself as to which of them was then in such possession of the subject of dispute, he
may attach the subject of dispute until a competent Court has determined the rights of the parties thereto
with regard to the person entitled to the possession thereof:
     Provided that such Magistrate may withdraw the attachment at any time if he is satisfied that there is
no longer any likelihood of breach of the peace with regard to the subject of dispute.
     (2) When the Magistrate attaches the subject of dispute, he may, if no receiver in relation to such
subject of dispute has been appointed by any Civil Court, make such arrangements as he considers proper
for looking after the property or if he thinks fit, appoint a receiver thereof, who shall have, subject to the
control of the Magistrate, all the powers of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(5 of 1908):
     Provided that in the event of a receiver being subsequently appointed in relation to the subject of
dispute by any Civil Court, the Magistrate—
          (a) shall order the receiver appointed by him to hand over the possession of the subject of dispute
     to the receiver appointed by the Civil Court and shall thereafter discharge the receiver appointed by
     him;

        (b) may make such other incidental or consequential orders as may be just.
    147. Dispute concerning right of use of land or water.—(1) Whenever an Executive Magistrate is
                                                        76
satisfied from the report of a police officer or upon other information, that a dispute likely to cause a
breach of the peace exists regarding any alleged right of user of any land or water within his local
jurisdiction, whether such right be claimed as an easement or otherwise, he shall make an order in
writing, stating the grounds of his being so satisfied and requiring the parties concerned in such
dispute to attend his Court in person or by pleader on a specified date and time and to put in written
statements of their respective claims.
     Explanation.—The expression “land or water” has the meaning given to it in sub-section (2) of
section 145.
     (2) The Magistrate shall then persue the statements so put in, hear the parties, receive all such
evidence as may be produced by them respectively, consider the effect of such evidence, take such further
evidence, if any, as he thinks necessary and, if possible, decide whether such right exists; and the
provisions of section 145 shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of such inquiry.
     (3) If it appears to such Magistrate that such rights exist, he may make an order prohibiting any
interference with the exercise of such right, including, in a proper case, an order for the removal of any
obstruction in the exercise of any such right:
     Provided that no such order shall be made where the right is exercisable at all times of the year,
unless such right has been exercised within three months next before the receipt under sub-section (1) of
the report of a police officer or other information leading to the institution of the inquiry, or where the
right is exercisable only at particular seasons or on particular occasions, unless the right has been
exercised during the last of such seasons or on the last of such occasions before such receipt.
     (4) When in any proceedings commenced under sub-section (1) of section 145 the Magistrate finds
that the dispute is as regards an alleged right of user of land or water, he may, after recording his reasons,
continue with the proceedings as if they had been commenced under sub-section (1),
and when in any proceedings commenced under sub-section (1) the magistrate finds that the dispute
should be dealt with under section 145, he may, after recording his reasons, continue with the proceedings
as if they had been commenced under sub-section (1) of section 145.
     148. Local inquiry.—(1) Whenever a local inquiry is necessary for the purposes of section 145, section 146 or
section 147, a District Magistrate or Sub-divisional Magistrate may depute any Magistrate subordinate to him to
make the inquiry, and may furnish him with such written instructions as may seem necessary for his guidance, and
may declare by whom the whole or any part of the necessary expenses of the inquiry shall be paid.
     (2) The report of the person so deputed may be read as evidence in the case.
     (3) When any costs have been incurred by any party to a proceeding under section 145, section 146 or section
147, the Magistrate passing a decision may direct by whom such costs shall be paid, whether by such party or by any
other party to the proceeding, and whether in whole or in part or proportion and such costs may include any
expenses incurred in respect of witnesses and of pleaders’ fees, which the Court may consider reasonable.

have been committed, to make a complaint in respect of that offence before a Magistrate having
jurisdiction or the power of such Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence upon such complaint.

                                      COMPLAINTS TO MAGISTRATES

    200. Examination of complainant.—A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint
shall examine upon oath the complainant and the witnesses present, if any, and the substance of such
examination shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the complainant and the witnesses, and
also by the Magistrate:

   Provided that, when the complaint is made in writing, the Magistrate need not examine the
complainant and the witnesses—

        (a) if a public servant acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties or a Court
    has made the complaint; or

        (b) if the Magistrate makes over the case for inquiry or trial to another Magistrate under
    section 192:

    Provided further that if the Magistrate makes over the case to another Magistrate under section 192
after examining the complainant and the witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re-examine them.

    201. Procedure by Magistrate not competent to take cognizance of the case.—If the complaint is

                                                     103
made to a Magistrate who is not competent to take cognizance of the offence, he shall,—

        (a) if the complaint is in writing, return it for presentation to the proper Court with an
     endorsement to that effect;

          (b) if the complaint is not in writing, direct the complainant to the proper Court.

      202. Postponement of issue of process.—(1) Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence
of which he is authorised to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under section 192, may,
if he thinks fit, 1[and shall, in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he
exercises his jurisdiction,] postpone the issue of process against the accused, and either inquire into the
case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks
fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding:

     Provided that no such direction for investigation shall be made,—

        (a) where it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable exclusively by the
     Court of Session; or

         (b) where the complaint has not been made by a Court, unless the complainant and the witnesses
     present (if any) have been examined on oath under section 200.

    (2) In an inquiry under sub-section (1), the Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, take evidence of witnesses
on oath:

    Provided that if it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable exclusively by
the Court of Session, he shall call upon the complainant to produce all his witnesses and examine them on
oath.

    (3) If an investigation under sub-section (1) is made by a person not being a police officer, he shall
have for that investigation all the powers conferred by this Code on an officer in charge of a police station
except the power to arrest without warrant.
    203. Dismissal of complaint.—If, after considering the statements on oath (if any) of the
complainant and of the witnesses and the result of the inquiry or investigation (if any) under section 202,
the Magistrate is of opinion that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding, he shall dismiss the
complaint, and in every such case he shall briefly record his reasons for so doing.


                                                       CHAPTER XVI
                             COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE MAGISTRATES
    204. Issue of process.—(1) If in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence there is
sufficient ground for proceeding, and the case appears to be—
          (a) a summons-case, he shall issue his summons for the attendance of the accused, or
         (b) a warrant-case, he may issue a warrant, or, if he thinks fit, a summons, for causing the accused
     to be brought or to appear at a certain time before such Magistrate or (if he has no jurisdiction
     himself) some other Magistrate having jurisdiction.
    (2) No summons or warrant shall be issued against the accused under sub-section (1) until a list of the
prosecution witnesses has been filed.


1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 19 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).
                                                           104
   (3) In a proceeding instituted upon a complaint made in writing, every summons or warrant issued
under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied by a copy of such complaint.
    (4) When by any law for the time being in force any process-fees or other fees are payable, no process
shall be issued until the fees are paid and, if such fees are not paid within a reasonable time, the
Magistrate may dismiss the complaint.
     (5) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of section 87.
    205. Magistrate may dispense with personal attendance of accused.—(1) Whenever a Magistrate
issues a summons, he may, if he sees reason so to do, dispense with the personal attendance of the
accused and permit him to appear by his pleader.
     (2) But the Magistrate inquiring into or trying the case may, in his discretion, at any stage of the
proceedings, direct the personal attendance of the accused, and, if necessary, enforce such attendance in
the manner hereinbefore provided.
    206. Special summons in cases of petty offence.—(1) If, in the opinion of a Magistrate taking
cognizance of a petty offence, the case may be summarily disposed of under section 260 1[or section 261],
the Magistrate shall, except where he is, for reasons to be recorded in writing of a contrary opinion, issue
summons to the accused requiring him either to appear in person or by pleader before the Magistrate on a
specified date, or if he desires to plead guilty to the charge without appearing before the Magistrate, to
transmit before the specified date, by post or by messenger to the Magistrate, the said plea in writing and
the amount of fine specified in the summons or if he desires to appear by pleader and to plead guilty to
the charge through such pleader, to authorise, in writing, the pleader to plead guilty to the charge on his
behalf and to pay the fine through such pleader:
    Provided that the amount of the fine specified in such summons shall not exceed 2[one thousand
rupees].
    (2) For the purposes of this section, “petty offence” means any offence punishable only with fine
not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1939 (4 of 1939) 3, or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused
person in his absence on a plea of guilty.
     4
     [(3) The State Government may, by notification, specially empower any Magistrate to exercise
the powers conferred by sub-section (1) in relation to any offence which is compoundable under
section 320 or any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or
with fine, or with both where the Magistrate is of opinion that, having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, the imposition of fine only would meet the ends of justice.]
    207. Supply to the accused of copy of police report and other documents.—In any case where
the proceeding has been instituted on a police report, the Magistrate shall without delay furnish to the
accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following:—
          (i) the police report;
          (ii) the first information report recorded under section 154;
         (iii) the statements recorded under sub-section (3) of section 161 of all persons whom the
     prosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses, excluding therefrom any part in regard to
     which a request for such exclusion has been made by the police officer under sub -section (6) of

1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 20 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).
2. Subs. by, s. 20, ibid., for “one hundred rupees” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).
3. Now the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (59 of 1988).
4. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 18 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).
                                                               105
     section 173;
          (iv) the confessions and statements, if any, recorded under section 164;
          (v) any other document or relevant extract thereof forwarded to the Magistrate with the police
     report under sub-section (5) of section 173:
     Provided that the Magistrate may, after perusing any such part of a statement as is referred to in
clause (iii) and considering the reasons given by the police officer for the request, direct that a copy
of that part of the statement or of such portion thereof as the Magistrate thinks proper, shall be
furnished to the accused:
     Provided further that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any document refer red to in clause (v) is
voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only
be allowed to inspect it either personally or through pleader in Court.
     208. Supply of copies of statements and documents to accused in other cases triable by
Court of Session.—Where, in a case instituted otherwise than on a police report, it appears to the
Magistrate issuing process under section 204 that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of
Session, the Magistrate shall without delay furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the
following:—
          (i) the statements recorded under section 200 or section 202, of all persons examined by the
     Magistrate;
          (ii) the statements and confessions, if any, recorded under section 161 or section 164;
          (iii) any documents produced before the Magistrate on which the prosecution proposes to
     rely:
     Provided that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any such document is voluminous, he shall, instead
of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only be allowed to inspect it either
personally or through pleader in Court.
     209. Commitment of case to Court of Session when offence is triable exclusively by it.—When in
a case instituted on a police report or otherwise, the accused appears or is brought before the Magistrate
and it appears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, he shall—
          1
            [(a) commit, after complying with the provisions of section 207 or section 208, as the case may
     be, the case to the Court of Session, and subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand
     the accused to custody until such commitment has been made;]
          (b) subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand the accused to custody during,
     and until the conclusion of, the trial;
          (c) send to that Court the record of the case and the documents and articles, if any, which are to
     be produced in evidence;
          (d) notify the Public Prosecutor of the commitment of the case to the Court of Session.
                                            STATE AMENDMENT
    Gujarat
    In section 209 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in its application to the State of Gujarat, for
clause (a), the following clause shall be substituted, namely:—
    “(a) Commit the case, after complying with the provisions of section 207 or section 208, as the case
may be, to the Court of Session and, subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand the accused
to custody until such commitment has been made”.
    [Vide Gujarat Act 30 of 1976, s. 2]
    210. Procedure to be followed when there is a complaint case and police investigation in respect
of the same offence.—(1) When in a case instituted otherwise than on a police report (hereinafter
referred to as a complaint case), it is made to appear to the Magistrate, during the course of the inquiry or
trial held by him, that an investigation by the police is in progress in relation to the offence which is the
subject-matter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall stay the proceedings of such inquiry
or trial and call for a report on the matter from the police officer conducting the investigation.
     (2) If a report is made by the investigating police officer under section 173 and on such report

1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 19, for clause (a) (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).
                                                                106
cognizance of any offence is taken by the Magistrate against any person who is an accused in the
complaint case, the Magistrate shall inquire into or try together the complaint case and the case arising out
of the police report as if both the cases were instituted on a police report.
     (3) If the police report does not relate to any accused in the complaint case or if the Magistrate does
not take cognizance of any offence on the police report, he shall proceed with the inquiry or trial, which
was stayed by him, in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
                                                      CHAPTER XVII
                                                        THE CHARGE
                                                   A.—Form of charges

    211. Contents of charge.—(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the
accused is charged.
     (2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in
the charge by that name only.
     (3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition
of the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.
   (4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be
mentioned in the charge.

    (5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by
law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.

    (6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court.

    (7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any offence, is liable, by reason of such
previous conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent
offence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment
which the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous
conviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at
any time before sentence is passed.

                                                          Illustrations

         (a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definition of murder
    given in sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions
    of the said Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to section 300, or that, if it did fall within
    Exception 1, one or other of the three provisos to that exception applied to it.

         (b) A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B
    by means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335
    of the said Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it.

         (c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark.
    The charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or
    that he used a false property-mark, without reference to the definitions, of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code
    (45 of 1860); but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance be referred to in the charge.

        (d) A is charged under section 184 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) with intentionally obstructing a sale of
    property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.

    212. Particulars as to time, place and person.—(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to
the time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if any) in
                                                              107
respect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter
with which he is charged.

    (2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money
or other movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, describe
the movable property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates
between which the offence is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact
dates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of
section 219:

    Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year.

    213. When manner of committing offence must be stated.—When the nature of the case is such
that the particulars mentioned in sections 211 and 212 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the
matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the
alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose.

                                                         Illustrations

        (a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in
    which the theft was effected.

         (b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B.

         (c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The charge must set out that portion of the
    evidence given by A which is alleged to be false.

        (d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place.
    The charge must set out the manner in which A obstructed B in the discharge of his functions.

        (e) A is accused of the murder of B at a given time and place. The charge need not state the manner in which A
    murdered B.

         (f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment. The charge must set out the
    disobedience charged and the law infringed.

    214. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable.—In every charge
words used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense attached to them
respectively by the law under which such offence is punishable.
     215. Effect of errors.— No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated
in the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any stage of
the case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has
occasioned a failure of justice.
                                                            Illustrations

         (a) A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with “having been in possession of
    counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit,” the word
    “fraudulently” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not
    be regarded as material.

          (b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or is set out
    incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this
    that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.

         (c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many
                                                             108
    transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no
    defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a
    material error.

        (d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was
    Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and
    had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer
    from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.

          (e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him
    for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of
    Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from
    this that A was misled, and that the error was material.

    216. Court may alter charge.—(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before
judgment is pronounced.
    (2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.
     (3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not
likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct
of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with
the trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge.
    (4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the
opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a
new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.
    (5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous
sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction
has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added
charge is founded.

   217. Recall of witnesses when charge altered.—Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the
Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed—

        (a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness
    who may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that
    the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the
    purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice;

        (b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.

                                               B.—Joinder of charges

    218. Separate charges for distinct offences.—(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is
accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately:

    Provided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is
of opinion that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or

under section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under any section of the said Code, or

charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences.

    (4) If several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence,
constitute when combined a different offence, the person accused of them may be charged with, and tried
at one trial for the offence constituted by such acts when combined, and for any offence constituted by
any one, or more, of such acts.

    221. Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed.—(1) If a single act or series of acts is
of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute,
the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such
charges may be tried at once; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of
the said offences.

     (2) If in such a case the accused is charged with one offence, and it appears in evidence that he
committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of sub-section

    222. When offence proved included in offence charged.—(1) When a person is charged with an
offence consisting of several particulars, a combination of some only of which constitutes a complete
minor offence, and such combination is proved, but the remaining particulars are not proved, he may be
convicted of the minor offence, though he was not charged with it.

    (2) When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence,
he may be convicted of the minor offence, although he is not charged with it.

offence although the attempt is not separately charged.

conditions requisite for the initiation of proceedings in respect of that minor offence have not been
satisfied.

    in respect of the property, but that it was not entrusted to him as a carrier. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust
    under the said section 406.

           (b) A is charged, under section 325 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with causing grievous hurt. He proves that

    committed by the first-named persons, or of abetment of or attempting to commit any such last-
    named offence;

         (g) persons accused of any offence under Chapter XII of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)
     relating to counterfeit coin and persons accused of any other offence under the said Chapter relating
     to the same coin, or of abetment of or attempting to commit any such offence; and the provisions
     contained in the former part of this Chapter shall, so far as may be, apply to all such charges:

     Provided that where a number of persons are charged with separate offences and such persons do not
fall within any of the categories specified in this section, the 1[Magistrate or Court of Session] may, if
such persons by an application in writing, so desire, and 2[if he or it is satisfied] that such persons would
not be prejudicially affected thereby, and it is expedient so to do, try all such persons together.
    224. Withdrawal of remaining charges on conviction on one of several charges.—When a charge
containing more heads than one is framed against the same person, and when a conviction has been had
on one or more of them, the complainant, or the officer conducting the prosecution, may, with the consent
of the Court, withdraw the remaining charge or charges, or the Court of its own accord may stay the
inquiry into, or trial of, such charge or charges and such withdrawal shall have the effect of an acquittal
on such charge or charges, unless the conviction be set aside, in which case the said Court (subject to the
order of the Court setting aside the conviction) may proceed with the inquiry into, or trial of, the charge or
charges so withdrawn.

     and, by order, transfer the case for trial to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, 3[or any other Judicial
     Magistrate of the first class and direct the accused to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, or,
     as the case may be, the Judicial Magistrate of the first class, on such date as he deems fit, and

be refused on the ground that it is made for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice and
such ground shall be recorded by him in writing:

    (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent a Magistrate from discharging the accused at any
previous stage of the case if, for reasons to be recorded by such Magistrate, he considers the charge to be groundless.

      “(3) If all the evidence referred to in section 244 are not produced in support of the prosecution
   within four years from the date of appearance of the accused, the Magistrate shall discharge the accused
   unless the prosecution satisfies the Magistrate that upon the evidence already produced and for special
   reasons there is ground for presuming that it shall not be in the interest of justice to discharge the
   accused.”.

       [Vide West Bengal Act 24 of 1988, s. 5.]

    246. Procedure where accused is not discharged.—(1) If, when such evidence has been taken, or at any
previous stage of the case, the Magistrate is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has
committed an offence triable under this Chapter, which such Magistrate is competent to try and which, in his
opinion, could be adequately punished by him, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused.

    (2) The charge shall then be read and explained to the accused, and he shall be asked whether he pleads guilty
or has any defence to make.

     (3) If the accused pleads guilty, the Magistrate shall record the plea, and may, in his discretion, convict him
thereon.

    (4) If the accused refuses to plead, or does not plead or claims to be tried or if the accused is not convicted
under sub-section (3), he shall be required to state, at the commencement of the next hearing of the case, or, if the
Magistrate for reasons to be recorded in writing so thinks fit, forthwith, whether he wishes to cross-examine any,
and, if so, which, of the witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence has been taken.

     (5) If he says he does so wish, the witnesses named by him shall be recalled and, after cross-examination and
re-examination (if any), they shall be discharged.

                                                         117
    (6) The evidence of any remaining witnesses for the prosecution shall next be taken, and after
cross-examination and re-examination (if any), they shall also be discharged.

    (2) Where, in any case under this Chapter, the Magistrate finds the accused guilty, but does not proceed in
accordance with the provisions of section 325 or section 360, he shall, after hearing the accused on the question of
sentence, pass sentence upon him according to law.

    (3) Where, in any case under this Chapter, a previous conviction is charged under the provisions of
sub-section (7) of section 211 and the accused does not admit that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the
charge, the Magistrate may, after he has convicted the said accused, take evidence in respect of the alleged previous
conviction, and shall record a finding thereon:
     Provided that no such charge shall be read out by the Magistrate nor shall the accused be asked to plead thereto
nor shall the previous conviction be referred to by the prosecution or in any evidence adduced by it, unless and until
the accused has been convicted under sub-section (2).
     249. Absence of complainant.—When the proceedings have been instituted upon complaint, and on any day
fixed for the hearing of the case, the complainant is absent, and the offence may be lawfully compounded or is not a
cognizable offence, the Magistrate may, in his discretion, notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, at any
time before the charge has been framed, discharge the accused.
    250. Compensation for accusation without reasonable cause.—(1) If, in any case instituted upon complaint
or upon information given to a police officer or to a Magistrate, one or more persons is or are accused before a
Magistrate of any offence triable by a Magistrate, and the Magistrate by whom the case is heard discharges or
acquits all or any of the accused, and is of opinion that there was no reasonable ground for making the accusation
against them or any of them, the Magistrate may, by his order of discharge or acquittal, if the person upon whose
complaint or information the accusation was made is present, call upon him forthwith to show cause why he should
not pay compensation to such accused or to each or any of such accused when there are more than one; or, if such
person is not present, direct the issue of a summons to him to appear and show cause as aforesaid.
     (2) The Magistrate shall record and consider any cause which such complainant or informant may show, and if
he is satisfied that there was no reasonable ground for making the accusation, may, for reasons to be recorded, make
an order that compensation to such amount, not exceeding the amount of fine he is empowered to impose, as he may
determine, be paid by such complainant or informant to the accused or to each or any of them.
     (3) The Magistrate may, by the order directing payment of the compensation under sub-section (2), further order
that, in default of payment, the person ordered to pay such compensation shall undergo simple imprisonment for a
period not exceeding thirty days.
    (4) When any person is imprisoned under sub-section (3), the provisions of sections 68 and 69 of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall, so far as may be, apply.
    (5) No person who has been directed to pay compensation under this section shall, by reason of such order, be
exempted from any civil or criminal liability in respect of the complaint made or information given by him:
   Provided that any amount paid to an accused person under this section shall be taken into account in awarding
compensation to such person in any subsequent civil suit relating to the same matter.
     (6) A complainant or informant who has been ordered under sub-section (2) by a Magistrate of the second class
to pay compensation exceeding one hundred rupees, may appeal from the order, as if such complainant or informant
                                                        118
had been convicted on a trial held by such Magistrate.
    (7) When an order for payment of compensation to an accused person is made in a case which is subject to
appeal under sub-section (6), the compensation shall not be paid to him before the period allowed for the
presentation of the appeal has elapsed, or, if an appeal is presented, before the appeal has been decided; and where
such order is made in a case which is not so subject to appeal the compensation shall not be paid before the
expiration of one month from the date of the order.
    (8) The provisions of this section apply to summons-cases as well as to warrant-cases.

issued under section 206 and the accused desires to plead guilty to the charge without appearing before the
Magistrate, he shall transmit to the Magistrate, by post or by messenger, a letter containing his plea and also the
amount of fine specified in the summons.

     (2) The Magistrate may, in his discretion, convict the accused in his absence, on his plea of guilty and sentence
him to pay the fine specified in the summons, and the amount transmitted by the accused shall be adjusted towards
that fine, or where a pleader authorised by the accused in this behalf pleads guilty on behalf of the accused, the
Magistrate shall record the plea as nearly as possible in the words used by the pleader and may, in his discretion,
convict the accused on such plea and sentence him as aforesaid.

     254. Procedure when not convicted.—(1) If the Magistrate does not convict the accused under section 252 or

     (2) The Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, on the application of the prosecution or the accused, issue a summons
to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any document or other thing.

expenses of the witness incurred in attending for the purposes of the trial be deposited in Court.

     255. Acquittal or conviction.—(1) If the Magistrate, upon taking the evidence referred to in section 254 and

                                                         119
     (2) Where the Magistrate does not proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 325 or section 360, he
shall, if he finds the accused guilty, pass sentence upon him according to law.

   (3) A Magistrate may, under section 252 or section 255, convict the accused of any offence triable under this
Chapter, which from the facts admitted or proved he appears to have committed, whatever may be the nature of the
complaint or summons, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the accused would not be prejudiced thereby.

    256. Non-appearance or death of complainant.—(1) If the summons has been issued on complaint, and on
the day appointed for the appearance of the accused, or any day subsequent thereto to which the hearing may be
adjourned, the complainant does not appear, the Magistrate shall, notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained,
acquit the accused, unless for some reason he thinks it proper to adjourn the hearing of the case to some other day:

   Provided that where the complainant is represented by a pleader or by the officer conducting the prosecution or
where the Magistrate is of opinion that the personal attendance of the complainant is not necessary, the Magistrate
may, dispense with his attendance and proceed with the case.
     (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall, so far as may be, apply also to cases where the non-appearance of
the complainant is due to his death.
     257. Withdrawal of complaint.—If a complainant, at any time before a final order is passed in any case under
this Chapter, satisfies the Magistrate that there are sufficient grounds for permitting him to withdraw his complaint
against the accused, or if there be more than one accused, against all or any of them, the Magistrate may permit him
to withdraw the same, and shall thereupon acquit the accused against whom the complaint is so withdrawn.
     258. Power to stop proceedings in certain cases.—In any summons-case instituted otherwise than upon
complaint, a Magistrate of the first class or, with the previous sanction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, any other
Judicial Magistrate, may, for reasons to be recorded by him, stop the proceedings at any stage without pronouncing
any judgment and where such stoppage of proceedings is made after the evidence of the principal witnesses has been
recorded, pronounce a judgment of acquittal, and in any other case, release the accused, and such release shall have
the effect of discharge.
      259. Power of Court to convert summons-cases into warrant-cases.—When in the course of the trial of a
summons-case relating to an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding six months, it appears to
the Magistrate that in the interests of justice, the offence should be tried in accordance with the procedure for the
trial of warrant-cases, such Magistrate may proceed to re-hear the case in the manner provided by this Code for the
trial of warrant-cases and may re-call any witness who may have been examined.

being in force,—

          (a) by an extract certified under the hand of the officer having the custody of the records of the Court in
    which such conviction or acquittal was held, to be a copy of the sentence or order, or

         (b) in case of a conviction, either by a certificate signed by the officer in charge of the Jail in which the
     punishment or any part thereof was undergone, or by production of the warrant of commitment under which the

that there is no immediate prospect of arresting him, the Court competent to try 1[, or commit for trial,] such person
for the offence complained of may, in his absence, examine the witnesses (if any) produced on behalf of the
prosecution, and record their depositions and any such deposition may, on the arrest of such person, be given in
evidence against him on the inquiry into, or trial for, the offence with which he is charged, if the deponent is dead or
incapable of giving evidence or cannot be found or his presence cannot be procured without an amount of delay,
expense or inconvenience which, under the circumstances of the case, would be unreasonable.

     (2) If it appears that an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life has been committed by some
person or persons unknown, the High Court or the Sessions Judge may direct that any Magistrate of the first class
shall hold an inquiry and examine any witnesses who can give evidence concerning the offence and any depositions
so taken may be given in evidence against any person who is subsequently accused of the offence, if the deponent is
dead or incapable of giving evidence or beyond the limits of India.

     300. Person once convicted or acquitted not to be tried for same offence.—(1) A person who has once been
tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or acquitted of such offence shall, while such
conviction or acquittal remains in force, not be liable to be tried again for the same offence, nor on the same facts for
any other offence for which a different charge from the one made against him might have been made under
sub-section (1) of section 221, or for which he might have been convicted under sub-section (2) thereof.

      (2) A person acquitted or convicted of any offence may be afterwards tried, with the consent of the State
Government, for any distinct offence for which a separate charge might have been made against him at the former
trial under sub-section (1) of section 220.

     (3) A person convicted of any offence constituted by any act causing consequences which, together with such
act, constituted a different offence from that of which he was convicted, may be afterwards tried for such last
mentioned offence, if the consequences had not happened, or were not known to the Court to have happened, at the
time when he was convicted.

    (4) A person acquitted convicted of any offence constituted by any acts may, notwithstanding such acquittal or
conviction, be subsequently charged with, and tried for, any other offence constituted by the same acts which he

may have committed if the Court by which he was first tried was not competent to try the offence with which he is
subsequently charged.

     (5) A person discharged under section 258 shall not be tried again for the same offence except with the consent
of the Court by which he was discharged or of any other Court to which the first-mentioned Court is subordinate.

    (6) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of section 26 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897 (10 of 1897) or of section 188 of this Code.

     Explanation.—The dismissal of a complaint, or the discharge of the accused, is not an acquittal for the purposes
of this section.

                                                            Illustrations

        (e) A is charged by a Magistrate of the second class with, and convicted by him of, theft of property from the person of
    B. A may subsequently be charged with, and tried for, robbery on the same facts.

    afterwards be charged with, and tried for, dacoity on the same facts.

      301. Appearance by Public Prosecutors.—(1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge
of a case may appear and plead without any written authority before any Court in which that case is under inquiry,
trial or appeal.

     (2) If in any such case any private person instructs a pleader to prosecute any person in any Court, the Public
Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of the case shall conduct the prosecution, and the pleader so
instructed shall act therein under the directions of the Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor, and may,
with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the evidence is closed in the case.

shall be entitled to do so without such permission:

    Provided that no police officer shall be permitted to conduct the prosecution if he has taken part in the
investigation into the offence with respect to which the accused is being prosecuted.

    (2) Any person conducting the prosecution may do so personally or by a pleader.

    303. Right of person against whom proceedings are instituted to be defended.—Any person accused of an
offence before a Criminal Court, or against whom proceedings are instituted under this Code, may of right be
defended by a pleader of his choice.

    304. Legal aid to accused at State expense in certain cases.—(1) Where, in a trial before the Court of Session,
the accused is not represented by a pleader, and where it appears to the Court that the accused has not sufficient
means to engage a pleader, the Court shall assign a pleader for his defence at the expense of the State.

    (2) The High Court may, with the previous approval of the State Government, make rules providing for—

         (a) the mode of selecting pleaders for defence under sub-section (1);

        (c) the fees payable to such pleaders by the Government, and generally, for carrying out the purposes of
    sub-section (1).

     (3) The State Government may, by notification, direct that, as from such date as may be specified in the

Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860).

    (2) Where a corporation is the accused person or one of the accused persons in an inquiry or trial, it may appoint
a representative for the purpose of the inquiry or trial and such appointment need not be under the seal of the
corporation.

     (3) Where a representative of a corporation appears, any requirement of this Code that anything shall be done in
the presence of the accused or shall be read or stated or explained to the accused, shall be construed as a requirement
that thing shall be done in the presence of the representative or read or stated or explained to the representative, and
any requirement that the accused shall be examined shall be construed as a requirement that the representative shall
be examined.

    (4) Where a representative of a corporation does not appear, any such requirement as is referred to in
sub-section (3) shall not apply.

    (5) Where a statement in writing purporting to be signed by the managing director of the corporation or by any
person (by whatever name called) having, or being one of the persons having the management of the affairs of the
corporation to the effect that the person named in the statement has been appointed as the representative of the
corporation for the purposes of this section, is filed, the Court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that such
person has been so appointed.

     (6) If a question arises as to whether any person, appearing as the representative of a corporation in an inquiry
or trial before a Court is or is not such representative, the question shall be determined by the Court.

    306. Tender of pardon to accomplice.—(1) With a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to
have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence to which this section applies, the Chief Judicial

                                                           134
Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate at any stage of the investigation or inquiry into, or the trial of, the offence,
and the Magistrate of the first class inquiring into or trying the offence, at any stage of the inquiry or trial, may
tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the
circumstances within his knowledge relative to the offence and to every other person concerned, whether as
principal or abettor, in the commission thereof.

    (2) This section applies to—

        (a) any offence triable exclusively by the Court of Session or by the Court of a Special Judge appointed
    under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (46 of 1952);

        (b) any offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or with a more severe
    sentence.

    (3) Every Magistrate who tenders a pardon under sub-section (1) shall record—

         (a) his reasons for so doing;

         (b) whether the tender was or was not accepted by the person to whom it was made,

and shall, on application made by the accused, furnish him with a copy of such record free of cost.

    (4) Every person accepting a tender of pardon made under sub-section (1)—

         (a) shall be examined as a witness in the Court of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence and in
    the subsequent trial, if any;

         (b) shall, unless he is already on bail, be detained in custody until the termination of the trial.

    (5) Where a person has accepted a tender of pardon made under sub-section (1) and has been examined under
sub-section (4), the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence shall, without making any further inquiry in the
case—

         (a) commit it for trial—

             (i) to the Court of Session if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court or if the Magistrate taking
         cognizance is the Chief Judicial Magistrate;

              (ii) to a Court of Special Judge appointed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (46 of 1952),
         if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court;

         (b) in any other case, make over the case to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who shall try the case himself.

     307. Power to direct tender of pardon.—At any time after commitment of a case but before judgment is
passed, the Court to which the commitment is made may, with a view to obtaining at the trial the evidence of any
person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in, or privy to, any such offence, tender a pardon on
the same condition to such person.

    308. Trial of person not complying with conditions of pardon.—(1) Where, in regard to a person who has
accepted a tender of pardon made under section 306 or section 307, the Public Prosecutor certifies that in his opinion
such person has, either by wilfully concealing anything essential or by giving false evidence, not complied with the
condition on which the tender was made, such person may be tried for the offence in respect of which the pardon
was so tendered or for any other offence of which he appears to have been guilty in connection with the same
matter, and also for the offence of giving false evidence:

                                                           135
    Provided that such person shall not be tried jointly with any of the other accused:

    Provided further that such person shall not be tried for the offence of giving false evidence except with the
sanction of the High Court, and nothing contained in section 195 or section 340 shall apply to that offence.

     (2) Any statement made by such person accepting the tender of pardon and recorded by a Magistrate under
section 164 or by a Court under sub-section (4) of section 306 may be given in evidence against him at such trial.

    (3) At such trial, the accused shall be entitled to plead that he has complied with the condition upon which such
tender was made; in which case it shall be for the prosecution to prove that the condition has not been complied
with.

    (4) At such trial, the Court shall—

              (a) if it is a Court of Session, before the charge is read out and explained to the accused;

              (b) if it is the Court of a Magistrate, before the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution is taken,

ask the accused whether he pleads that he has complied with the conditions on which the tender of pardon was
made.

    (5) If the accused does so plead, the Court shall record the plea and proceed with the trial and it shall, before
passing judgment in the case, find whether or not the accused has complied with the conditions of the
pardon, and, if it finds that he has so complied, it shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Code, pass
judgment of acquittal.

    309. Power to postpone or adjourn proceedings.—1[(1) In every inquiry or trial the proceedings shall be
continued from day-to-day until all the witnesses in attendance have been examined, unless the Court finds the
adjournment of the same beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded:

    Provided that when the inquiry or trial relates to an offence under section 376, 2[section 376A, section 376AB, ,
section 376B, section 376C, section 376D, section 376DA or section DB of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the inquiry or
trial shall] be completed within a period of two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet.]

     (2) If the Court, after taking cognizance of an offence, or commencement of trial, finds it necessary or
advisable to postpone the commencement of, or adjourn, any inquiry or trial, it may, from time to time, for reasons
to be recorded, postpone or adjourn the same on such terms as it thinks fit, for such time as it considers reasonable,
and may by a warrant remand the accused if in custody:

     Provided that no Magistrate shall remand an accused person to custody under this section for a term exceeding
fifteen days at a time:

    Provided further that when witnesses are in attendance, no adjournment or postponement shall be granted,
without examining them, except for special reasons to be recorded in writing:
    3
    [Provided also that no adjournment shall be granted for the purpose only of enabling the accused person to
show cause against the sentence proposed to be imposed on him.]
        4
            [Provided also that—

              (a) no adjournment shall be granted at the request of a party, except where the circumstances are beyond

    the control of that party;

         (b) the fact that the pleader of a party is engaged in another Court, shall not be a ground for adjournment;

         (c) where a witness is present in Court but a party or his pleader is not present or the party or his pleader
    though present in Court, is not ready to examine or cross-examine the witness, the Court may, if thinks fit,
    record the statement of the witness and pass such orders as it thinks fit dispensing with the examination-in-chief
    or cross-examination of the witness, as the case may be.]

    Explanation 1.—If sufficient evidence has been obtained to raise a suspicion that the accused may have
committed an offence, and it appears likely that further evidence may be obtained by a remand, this is a reasonable
cause for a remand.

    Explanation 2.—The terms on which an adjournment or postponement may be granted include, in appropriate
cases, the payment of costs by the prosecution or the accused.

      [311A. Power of Magistrate to order person to give specimen signatures or handwriting.—If a Magistrate
of the first class is satisfied that, for the purposes of any investigation or proceeding under this Code, it is expedient
to direct any person, including an accused person, to give specimen signatures or handwriting, he may make an
order to that effect and in that case the person to whom the order relates shall be produced or shall attend at the time
and place specified in such order and shall give his specimen signatures or handwriting:
    Provided that no order shall be made under this section unless the person has at some time been arrested in
connection with such investigation or proceeding.]

     considers necessary;
         (b) shall, after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for his

     (3) The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions, or by giving

      [(5) The Court may take help of Prosecutor and Defence Counsel in preparing relevant questions which are to
be put to the accused and the Court may permit filing of written statement by the accused as sufficient compliance of
this section.]
     314. Oral arguments and memorandum of arguments.—(1) Any party to a proceeding may, as soon as may
be, after the close of his evidence, address concise oral arguments, and may, before he concludes the oral arguments,
if any, submit a memorandum to the Court setting forth concisely and under distinct headings, the arguments in
support of his case and every such memorandum shall form part of the record.
     (2) A copy of every such memorandum shall be simultaneously furnished to the opposite party.
     (3) No adjournment of the proceedings shall be granted for the purpose of filing the written arguments unless
the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers it necessary to grant such adjournment.

arguments.

or section 108, or section 109, or section 110, or under Chapter IX or under Part B, Part C or Part D of Chapter X,
may offer himself as a witness in such proceedings:

    Provided that in proceedings under section 108, section 109, or section 110, the failure of such person to give
evidence shall not be made the subject of any comment by any of the parties or the Court or give rise to any
presumption against him or any other person proceeded against together with him at the same inquiry.

    316. No influence to be used to induce disclosure.—Except as provided in sections 306 and 307, no influence,
by means of any promise or threat or otherwise, shall be used to an accused person to induce him to disclose or
withhold any matter within his knowledge.

    317. Provision for inquiries and trial being held in the absence of accused in certain cases.—(1) At any
stage of an inquiry or trial under this Code, if the Judge or Magistrate is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded, that the
personal attendance of the accused before the Court is not necessary in the interests of justice, or that the accused
persistently disturbs the proceedings in Court, the Judge or Magistrate may, if the accused is represented by a
pleader, dispense with his attendance and proceed with such inquiry or trial in his absence, and may, at any
subsequent stage of the proceedings, direct the personal attendance of such accused.

    (2) If the accused in any such case is not represented by a pleader, or if the Judge or Magistrate considers his
personal attendance necessary, he may, if he thinks fit and for reasons to be recorded by him, either adjourn such
inquiry or trial, or order that the case of such accused be taken up or tried separately.

     321. Withdrawal from prosecution.—The Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of a
case may, with the consent of the Court, at any time before the judgment is pronounced, withdraw from the
prosecution of any person either generally or in respect of any one or more of the offences for which he is tried; and,
upon such withdrawal,—

         (a) if it is made before a charge has been framed, the accused shall be discharged in respect of such offence
    or offences;

        (b) if it is made after a charge has been framed, or when under this Code no charge is required, he shall be
    acquitted in respect of such offence or offences:

    Provided that where such offence—

          (i) was against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or

         (ii) was investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment under the Delhi Special Police
   Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946), or

prosecution and the Court shall, before according consent, direct the Prosecutor to produce before it the permission
granted by the Central Government to withdraw from the prosecution.

    322. Procedure in cases which Magistrate cannot dispose of.—(1) If, in the course of any inquiry into an
offence or a trial before a Magistrate in any district, the evidence appears to him to warrant a presumption—

          (a) that he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, or

          (b) that the case is one which should be tried or committed for trial by some other Magistrate in the district,
     or

          (c) that the case should be tried by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, he shall stay the proceedings and submit
     the case, with a brief report explaining its nature, to the Chief Judicial Magistrate or to such other Magistrate,
     having jurisdiction, as the Chief Judicial Magistrate directs.

     (2) The Magistrate to whom the case is submitted may, if so empowered, either try the case himself, or refer it
to any Magistrate subordinate to him having jurisdiction, or commit the accused for trial.

     323. Procedure when, after commencement of inquiry or trial, Magistrate finds case should be
committed.—If, in any inquiry into an offence or a trial before a Magistrate, it appears to him at any stage of the
proceedings before signing the judgment that the case is one which ought to be tried by the Court of Session, he
shall commit it to that Court under the provisions hereinbefore contained 1[and thereupon the provisions of Chapter
XVIII shall apply to the commitment so made].

    324. Trial of persons previously convicted of offences against coinage, stamp-law or property.— (1)
Where a person, having been convicted of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860), with imprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, is again accused of any offence
punishable under either of those Chapters with imprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, and the
Magistrate before whom the case is pending is satisfied that there is ground for presuming that such person has
committed the offence, he shall be sent for trial to the Chief Judicial Magistrate or committed to the Court of
Session, unless the Magistrate is competent to try the case and is of opinion that he can himself pass an adequate
sentence if the accused is convicted.

     (2) When any person is sent for trial to the Chief Judicial Magistrate or committed to the Court of Session
under sub-section (1), any other person accused jointly with him in the same inquiry or trial shall be similarly sent or
committed, unless the Magistrate discharges such other person under section 239 or section 245, as the case may be.

     325. Procedure when Magistrate cannot pass sentence sufficiently severe.—(1) Whenever a Magistrate is of
opinion, after hearing the evidence for the prosecution and the accused, that the accused is guilty, and that he ought
to receive a punishment different in kind from, or more severe than, that which such Magistrate is empowered to
inflict, or, being a Magistrate of the second class, is of opinion that the accused ought to be required to execute a
bond under section 106, he may record the opinion and submit his proceedings, and forward the accused, to the
Chief Judicial Magistrate to whom he is subordinate.

     (2) When more accused than one are being tried together, and the Magistrate considers it necessary to proceed
under sub-section (1), in regard to any of such accused, he shall forward all the accused, who are in his opinion
guilty, to the Chief Judicial Magistrate.



1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 26 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).

    (3) The Chief Judicial Magistrate to whom the proceedings are submitted may, if he thinks fit, examine the
parties and recall and examine any witness who has already given evidence in the case and may call for and take any
further evidence and shall pass such judgment, sentence or order in the case as he thinks fit, and is according to law.

    326. Conviction or commitment on evidence partly recorded by one Magistrate and partly by
another.—(1) Whenever any 1[Judge or Magistrate], after having heard and recorded the whole or any part of the
evidence in any enquiry or a trial, ceases to exercise jurisdiction therein and is succeeded by another 1[Judge or
Magistrate] who has and who exercises such jurisdiction, the 1[Judge or Magistrate] so succeeding may act on the
evidence so recorded by his predecessor, or partly recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by himself:

    Provided that if the succeeding 1[Judge or Magistrate] is of opinion that further examination of any of the
witnesses whose evidence has already been recorded is necessary in the interests of Justice, he may re-summon any
such witness, and after such further examination, cross-examination and re-examination, if any, as he may permit,
the witness shall be discharged.

    (2) When a case is transferred under the provisions of this Code 2[from one judge to another Judge or from one
Magistrate to another Magistrate], the former shall be deemed to cease to exercise jurisdiction therein, and to be
succeeded by the latter, within the meaning of sub-section (1).

     (3) Nothing in this section applies to summary trials or to cases in which proceedings have been stayed under
section 322 or in which proceedings have been submitted to a superior Magistrate under section 325.

     327. Court to be open.—3[(1)] The place in which any Criminal Court is held for the purpose of inquiring into
or trying any offence shall be deemed to be an open Court, to which the public generally may have access, so far as
the same can conveniently contain them:

      Provided that the presiding Judge or Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, order at any stage of any inquiry into, or
trial of, any particular case, that the public generally, or any particular person, shall not have access to, or be or
remain in, the room or building used by the Court.
    4
      [(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (1), the inquiry into and trial of rape or an offence

section 376DB] section 376E of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)] shall be conducted in camera :

    Provided that the presiding Judge may, if he thinks fit, or on an application made by either of the parties, allow
any particular person to have access to, or be or remain in, the room or building used by the Court:
    6
        [Provided further that in camera trial shall be conducted as far as practicable by a woman Judge or Magistrate.]

    (3) Where any proceedings are held under sub-section (2), it shall not be lawful for any person to print or
publish any matter in relation to any such proceedings except with the previous permission of the Court:]
     6
       [Provided that the ban on printing or publication of trial proceedings in relation to an offence of rape may be
lifted, subject to maintaining confidentiality of name and address of the parties.]

                              PROVISIONS AS TO ACCUSED PERSONS OF UNSOUND MIND

     328. Procedure in case of accused being lunatic.—(1) When a Magistrate holding an inquiry has reason to
believe that the person against whom the inquiry is being held is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of
making his defence, the Magistrate shall inquire into the fact of such unsoundness of mind, and shall cause such
person to be examined by the civil surgeon of the district or such other medical officer as the State Government may
direct, and thereupon shall examine such surgeon or other officer as a witness, and shall reduce the examination to
writing.
     1
     [(1A) If the civil surgeon finds the accused to be of unsound mind, he shall refer such person to a psychiatrist
or clinical psychologist for care, treatment and prognosis of the condition and the psychiatrist or clinical
psychologist, as the case may be, shall inform the Magistrate whether the accused is suffering from unsoundness of
mind or mental retardation:

     Provided that if the accused is aggrieved by the information given by the psychiatric or clinical psychologist, as
the case may be, to the Magistrate, he may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist of—

          (a) head of psychiatry unit in the nearest government hospital; and

           (b) a faculty member in psychiatry in the nearest medical college.]

    (2) Pending such examination and inquiry, the Magistrate may deal with such person in accordance with the
provisions of section 330.
     2
      [(3) If such Magistrate is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (1A) is a person of unsound mind,
the Magistrate shall further determine whether the unsoundness of mind renders the accused incapable of entering
defence and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate shall record a finding to that effect, and shall
examine the record of evidence produced by the prosecution and after hearing the advocate of the accused but
without questioning the accused, if he finds that no prima facie case is made out against the accused, he shall,
instead of postponing the enquiry, discharge the accused and deal with him in the manner provided under
section 330:

     Provided that if the Magistrate finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused in respect of whom
a finding of unsoundness of mind is arrived at, he shall postpone the proceeding for such period, as in the opinion of
the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, is required for the treatment of the accused, and order the accused to be
dealt with as provided under section 330.

     (4) If such Magistrate is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (1A) is a person with mental

retardation, the Magistrate shall further determine whether the mental retardation renders the accused incapable of
entering defence, and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate shall order closure of the inquiry and deal
with the accused in the manner provided under section 330.]

    329. Procedure in case of person of unsound mind tried before Court.—(1) If at the trial of any person
before a Magistrate or Court of Session, it appears to the Magistrate or Court that such person is of unsound mind
and consequently incapable of making his defence, the Magistrate or Court shall, in the first instance, try the fact of
such unsoundness and incapacity, and if the Magistrate or Court, after considering such medical and other evidence
as may be produced before him or it, is satisfied of the fact, he or it shall record a finding to that effect and shall
postpone further proceedings in the case.
     1
      [(1A) If during trial, the Magistrate or Court of Sessions finds the accused to be of unsound mind, he or it shall
refer such person to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist for care and treatment, and the psychiatrist or clinical
psychologist, as the case may be shall report to the Magistrate or Court whether the accused is suffering from
unsoundness of mind:
     Provided that if the accused is aggrieved by the information given by the psychiatric or clinical psychologist, as
the case may be, to the Magistrate, he may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist of—
          (a) head of psychiatry unit in the nearest government hospital; and
          (b) a faculty member in psychiatry in the nearest medical college.]
     2
      [(2) If such Magistrate or Court is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (1A) is a person of
unsound mind, the Magistrate or Court shall further determine whether unsoundness of mind renders the accused
incapable of entering defence and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate or Court shall record a finding
to that effect and shall examine the record of evidence produced by the prosecution and after hearing the advocate of
the accused but without questioning the accused, if the Magistrate or Court finds that no prima facie case is made
out against the accused, he or it shall, instead of postponing the trial, discharge the accused and deal with him in the
manner provided under section 330:
     Provided that if the Magistrate or Court finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused in respect
of whom a finding of unsoundness of mind is arrived at, he shall postpone the trial for such period, as in the opinion
of the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, is required for the treatment of the accused.
    (3) If the Magistrate or Court finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused and he is incapable of
entering defence by reason of mental retardation, he or it shall not hold the trial and order the accused to be dealt
with in accordance with section 330.]
     3
      [330. Release of person of unsound mind pending investigation or trial.—(1) Whenever a person if found
under section 328 or section 329 to be incapable of entering defence by reason of unsoundness of mind or mental
retardation, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be shall, whether the case is one in which bail may be taken or
not, order release of such person on bail:
    Provided that the accused is suffering from unsoundness of mind or mental retardation which does not mandate
in-patient treatment and a friend or relative undertakes to obtain regular out-patient psychiatric treatment from the
nearest medical facility and to prevent from doing injury to himself or to any other person.
    (2) If the case is one in which, in the opinion of the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, bail cannot be
granted or if an appropriate undertaking is not given, he or it shall order the accused to be kept in such a place where
regular psychiatric treatment can be provided, and shall report the action taken to the State Government:
    Provided that no order for the detention of the accused in a lunatic asylum shall be made otherwise than in
accordance with such rules as the State Government may have made under the Mental Health Act, 1987 (14 of
1987).
     (3) Whenever a person is found under section 328 or section 329 to be incapable of entering defence by reason
of unsoundness of mind or mental retardation, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, shall keeping in view the
nature of the act committed and the extent of unsoundness of mind or mental retardation, further determine if the
release of the accused can be ordered:


1. Ins. by Act 5 of 2009, s. 26 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009)
2. Subs. by s. 26, ibid., for sub-section (2), (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).
3. Subs. by s. 27, ibid., for section 330 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).
                                                                  149
    Provided that—
        (a) if on the basis of medical opinion or opinion of a specialist, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be,
    decide to order discharge of the accused, as provided under section 328 or section 329, such release may be
    ordered, if sufficient security is given that the accused shall be prevented from doing injury to himself or to any
    other person;
        (b) if the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, is of opinion that discharge of the accused cannot be
    ordered, the transfer of the accused to a residential facility for persons of unsound mind or mental retardation
    may be ordered wherein the accused may be provided care and appropriate education and training.]
     331. Resumption of inquiry or trial.—(1) Whenever an inquiry or a trial is postponed under section 328 or
section 329, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, may at any time after the person concerned has ceased to
be of unsound mind, resume the inquiry or trial and require the accused to appear or be brought before such
Magistrate or Court.
     (2) When the accused has been released under section 330, and the sureties for his appearance produce him to
the officer whom the Magistrate or Court appoints in this behalf, the certificate of such officer that the accused is
capable of making his defence shall be receivable in evidence.
    332. Procedure on accused appearing before Magistrate or Court.—(1) If, when the accused appears or is
again brought before the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, the Magistrate or Court considers him capable of
making his defence, the inquiry or trial shall proceed.
    (2) If the Magistrate or Court considers the accused to be still incapable of making his defence, the Magistrate
or Court shall act according to the provisions of section 328 or section 329, as the case may be, and if the accused is
found to be of unsound mind and consequently incapable making his defence, shall deal with such accused in
accordance with the provisions of section 330.
     333. When accused appears to have been of sound mind.—When the accused appears to be of sound mind at
the time of inquiry or trial, and the Magistrate is satisfied from the evidence given before him that there is reason to
believe that the accused committed an act, which, if he had been of sound mind, would have been an offence, and
that he was, at the time when the act was committed, by reason of unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing the
nature of the act or that it was wrong or contrary to law, the Magistrate shall proceed with the case, and, if the
accused ought to be tried by the Court of Session, commit him for trial before the Court of Session.
     334. Judgment of acquittal on ground of unsoundness of mind.—Whenever any person is acquitted upon the
ground that, at the time at which he is alleged to have committed an offence, he was, by reason of unsoundness of
mind, incapable of knowing the nature of the act alleged as constituting the offence, or that it was wrong or contrary
to law, the finding shall state specifically whether he committed the act or not.
     335. Person acquitted on such ground to be detained in safe custody.—(1) Whenever the finding states that
the accused person committed the act alleged, the Magistrate or Court before whom or which the trial has been held,
shall, if such act would, but for the incapacity found, have constituted an offence,—
         (a) order such person to be detained in safe custody in such place and manner as the Magistrate or Court
    thinks fit; or
         (b) order such person to be delivered to any relative or friend of such person.
     (2) No order for the detention of the accused in a lunatic asylum shall be made under clause (a) of sub-section
(1) otherwise than in accordance with such rules as the State Government may have made under the Indian Lunacy
Act, 1912 (4 of 1912).
    (3) No order for the delivery of the accused to a relative or friend shall be made under clause (b) of sub-section
(1) except upon the application of such relative or friend and on his giving security to the satisfaction of the
Magistrate or Court that the person delivered shall—
         (a) be properly taken care of and prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person;
       (b) be produced for the inspection of such officer, and at such times and places, as the State Government
    may direct.

empower the officer in charge of the jail in which a person is confined under the provisions of section 330 or section
335 to discharge all or any of the functions of the Inspector-General of Prisons under section 337 or section 338.

    337. Procedure where lunatic prisoner is reported capable of making his defence.—If such person is
detained under the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 330, and in the case of a person detained in a jail, the
Inspector-General of Prisons, or, in the case of a person detained a lunatic asylum, the visitors of such asylum, or
any two of them shall certify that, in his or their opinion, such person is capable of making his defence, he shall be
taken before the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, at such time as the Magistrate or Court appoints, and the
Magistrate or Court shall deal with such person under the provisions of section 332; and the certificate of such
Inspector-General or visitors as aforesaid shall be receivable as evidence.
     338. Procedure where lunatic detained is declared fit to be released.—(1) If such person is detained under
the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 330, or section 335, and such Inspector-General or visitors shall certify
that, in his or their judgment, he may be released without danger of his doing injury to himself or to any other
person, the State Government may thereupon order him to be released, or to be detained in custody, or to be
transferred to a public lunatic asylum if he has not been already sent to such an asylum; and, in case it orders him to
be transferred to an asylum, may appoint a Commission, consisting of a Judicial and two medical officers.

    (2) Such Commission shall make a formal inquiry into the state of mind of such person, take such evidence as is
necessary, and shall report to the State Government, which may order his release or detention as it thinks fit.

     339. Delivery of lunatic to care of relative or friend.—(1) Whenever any relative or friend of any person
detained under the provisions of section 330 or section 335 desires that he shall be delivered to his care and custody,

satisfaction of such State Government, that the person delivered shall—

         (a) be properly taken care of and prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person;

       (b) be produced for the inspection of such officer, and at such times and places, as the State Government

        (c) in the case of a person detained under sub-section (2) of section 330, be produced when required before
    such Magistrate or Court,

order such person to be delivered to such relative or friend.

     (2) If the person so delivered is accused of any offence, the trial of which has been postponed by reason of his
being of unsound mind and incapable of making his defence, and the inspecting officer referred to in clause (b) of
sub-section (1), certifies at any time to the Magistrate or Court that such person is capable of making his defence,
such Magistrate or Court shall call upon the relative or friend to whom such accused was delivered to produce him
before the Magistrate or Court; and, upon such production the Magistrate or Court shall proceed in accordance with
the provisions of section 332, and the certificate of the inspecting office shall be receivable as evidence.

                                                  CHAPTER XXVI
                 PROVISIONS AS TO OFFENCES AFFECTING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
     340. Procedure in cases mentioned in section 195.—(1) When, upon an application made to it in this behalf or
otherwise, any Court is of opinion that it is expedient in the interests of Justice that an inquiry should be made into
any offence referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 195, which appears to have been committed in or in
relation to a proceeding in that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a document produced or given in evidence



                                                          151
in a proceeding in that Court, such Court may, after such preliminary inquiry, if any, as it thinks necessary,—

          (a) record a finding to that effect;

          (b) make a complaint thereof in writing;

          (c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having jurisdiction;

         (d) take sufficient security for the appearance of the accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged
     offence is non-bailable and the Court thinks it necessary so to do, send the accused in custody to such
     Magistrate; and

          (e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence before such Magistrate.

    (2) The power conferred on a Court by sub-section (1) in respect of an offence may, in any case where that
Court has neither made a complaint under sub-section (1) in respect of that offence nor rejected an application for
the making of such complaint, be exercised by the Court to which such former Court is subordinate within the
meaning of sub-section (4) of section 195.

     (3) A complaint made under this section shall be signed,—
         (a) where the Court making the complaint is a High Court, by such officer of the Court as the Court may
     appoint;
          1
         [(b) in any other case, by the presiding officer of the Court or by such officer of the Court as the Court
     may authorise in writing in this behalf.]
     (4) In this section, “Court” has the same meaning as in section 195.
     341. Appeal.—(1) Any person on whose application any Court other than a High Court has refused to make a
complaint under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of section 340, or against whom such a complaint has been made
by such Court, may appeal to the Court to which such former Court is subordinate within the meaning of sub-section
(4) of section 195, and the superior Court may thereupon, after notice to the parties concerned, direct the withdrawal
of the complaint, or, as the case may be, making of the complaint which such former Court might have made under
section 340, and, if it makes such complaint, the provisions of that section shall apply accordingly.
     (2) An order under this section, and subject to any such order, an order under section 340, shall be final, and
shall not be subject to revision.

     342. Power to order costs.—Any Court dealing with an application made to it for filing a complaint under
section 340 or an appeal under section 341, shall have power to make such order as to costs as may be just.

     343. Procedure of Magistrate taking cognizance.—(1) A Magistrate to whom a complaint is made under
section 340 or section 341 shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Chapter XV, proceed, as far as may be, to
deal with the case as if it were instituted on a police report.

    (2) Where it is brought to the notice of such Magistrate, or of any other Magistrate to whom the case may have
been transferred, that an appeal is pending against the decision arrived at in the judicial proceeding out of which the
matter has arisen, he may, if he thinks fit, at any stage, adjourn the hearing of the case until such appeal is decided.

     344. Summary procedure for trial for giving false evidence.—(1) If, at the time of delivery of any judgment
or final order disposing of any judicial proceeding, a Court of Session or Magistrate of the first class expresses an
opinion to the effect that any witness appearing in such proceeding had knowingly or wilfully given false evidence
or had fabricated false evidence with the intention that such evidence should be used in such proceeding, it or he
may, if satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the interest of justice that the witness should be tried summarily
for giving or fabricating, as the case may be, false evidence, take cognizance of the offence and may, after giving the

1. Subs. by Act 2 of 2006, s. 6, for clause (b) (w.e.f. 16-4-2006).
                                                                 152

offender summarily and sentence him to imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or to fine
which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.

   (2) In every such case the Court shall follow, as nearly as may be practicable, the procedure prescribed for
summary trials.

    (3) Nothing in this section shall affect the power of the Court to make a complaint under section 340 for the
offence, where it does not choose to proceed under this section.

     (4) Where, after any action is initiated under sub-section (1), it is made to appear to the Court of Session or
Magistrate of the first class that an appeal or an application for revision has been preferred or filed against the
judgment or order in which the opinion referred to in that sub-section has been expressed, it or he shall stay further
proceedings of the trial until the disposal of the appeal or the application for revision, as the case may be, and
thereupon the further proceedings of the trial shall abide by the results of the appeal or application for revision.

     345. Procedure in certain cases of contempt.—(1) When any such offence as is described in section 175,
section 178, section 179, section 180 or section 228 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) is committed in the view
or presence of any Civil, Criminal, or Revenue Court, the Court may cause the offender to be detained in custody,
and may, at any time before the rising of the Court or the same day, take cognizance of the offence and, after giving
the offender a reasonable opportunity of showing cause why he should not be punished under this section, sentence
the offender to fine not exceeding two hundred rupees, and, in default of payment of fine, to simple imprisonment
for a term which may extend to one month, unless such fine be sooner paid.
     (2) In every such case the Court shall record the fact constituting the offence, with the statement (if any) made
by the offender, as well as the finding and sentence.
      (3) If the offence is under section 228 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the record shall show the nature
and stage of the judicial proceeding in which the Court interrupted or insulted was sitting, and the nature of the
interruption or insult.

     346. Procedure where Court considers that case should not be dealt with under section 345.—(1) If the
Court in any case considers that a person accused of any of the offences referred to in section 345 and committed in its
view or presence should be imprisoned otherwise than in default of payment of fine, or that a fine exceeding two
hundred rupees should be imposed upon him, or such Court is for any other reason of opinion that the case should not
be disposed of under section 345, such Court, after recording the facts constituting the offence and the statement of the
accused as hereinbefore provided, may forward the case to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the same, and
may require security to be given for the appearance of such person before such Magistrate, or if sufficient security is
not given, shall forward such person in custody to such Magistrate.

     (2) The Magistrate to whom any case is forwarded under this section shall proceed to deal with, as far as may
be, as if it were instituted on a police report.

     348. Discharge of offender on submission of apology.—When any Court has under section 345 adjudged an
offender to punishment, or has under section 346 forwarded him to a Magistrate for trial, for refusing or omitting to
do anything which he was lawfully required to do or for any intentional insult or interruption, the Court may, in its
discretion, discharge the offender or remit the punishment on his submission to the order or requisition of such
Court, or on apology being made to its satisfaction.

    349. Imprisonment or committal of person refusing to answer or produce document.—If any witness or
person called to produce a document or thing before a Criminal Court refuses to answer such questions as are put to
him or to produce any document or thing in his possession or power which the Court requires him to produce, and

1. The word “Indian” omitted by Act 56 of 1974, s. 3 and the Second Schedule (w.e.f. 20-12-1974).

does not, after a reasonable opportunity has been given to him so to do, offer any reasonable excuse for such refusal,
such Court may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, sentence him to simple imprisonment, or by warrant under the
hand of the Presiding Magistrate or Judge commit him to the custody of an officer of the Court for any term not
exceeding seven days, unless in the meantime, such person consents to be examined and to answer, or to produce the
document or thing and in the event of his persisting in his refusal, he may be dealt with according to the provisions
of section 345 or section 346.

     350. Summary procedure for punishment for non-attendance by a witness in obedience to summons.—(1)
If any witness being summoned to appear before a Criminal Court is legally bound to appear at a certain place and
time in obedience to the summons and without just excuse neglects or refuses to attend at that place or time or
departs from the place where he has to attend before the time at which it is lawful for him to depart, and the Court
before which the witness is to appear is satisfied that it is expedient in the interest of justice that such a witness
should be tried summarily, the Court may take cognizance of the offence and after giving the offender an
opportunity of showing cause why he should not be punished under this section, sentence him to fine not exceeding
one hundred rupees.

    (2) In every such case the Court shall follow, as nearly as may be practicable, the procedure prescribed for
summary trials.
    351. Appeals from convictions under sections 344, 345, 349 and 350.—(1) Any person sentenced by any
Court other than a High Court under section 344, section 345, section 349, or section 350 may, notwithstanding
anything contained in this Code appeal to the Court to which decrees or orders made in such Court are ordinarily
appealable.

before himself or in contempt of his authority, or is brought under his notice as such Judge or Magistrate in the
course of a judicial proceeding.

disposal of the case, pronounce the judgment notwithstanding their absence.

     (7) No judgment delivered by any Criminal Court shall be deemed to be invalid by reason only of the absence

judgment, order the accused person to pay, by way of compensation, such amount as may be specified in the order to
the person who has suffered any loss or injury by reason of the act for which the accused person has been so
sentenced.

paid by the person so causing the arrest to the person so arrested, for his loss of time and expenses in the matter, as
the Magistrate thinks fit.

seven years or less, or when any person under twenty-one years of age or any woman is convicted of an offence not
punishable with death or imprisonment for life, and no previous conviction is proved against the offender, if it
appears to the Court before which he is convicted, regard being had to the age, character or antecedents of the
offender, and to the circumstances in which the offence was committed, that it is expedient that the offender should
be released on probation of good conduct, the Court may, instead of sentencing him at once to any punishment,
direct that he be released on his entering into a bond, with or without sureties, to appear and receive sentence when
called upon during such period (not exceeding three years) as the Court may direct, and in the meantime to keep the
peace and be of good behaviour:

     Provided that where any first offender is convicted by a Magistrate of the second class not specially empowered
by the High Court, and the Magistrate is of opinion that the powers conferred by this section should be exercised, he
shall record his opinion to that effect, and submit the proceedings to a Magistrate of the first class, forwarding the
accused to, or taking bail for his appearance before, such Magistrate, who shall dispose of the case in the manner
provided by sub-section (2).

may thereupon pass such sentence or make such order as he might have passed or made if the case had originally been
heard by him, and, if he thinks further inquiry or additional evidence on any point to be necessary, he may make such
inquiry or take such evidence himself or direct such inquiry or evidence to be made or taken.

     (3) In any case in which a person is convicted of theft, theft in a building, dishonest misappropriation, cheating
or any offence under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), punishable with not more than two years, imprisonment or
any offence punishable with fine only and no previous conviction is proved against him, the Court before which he
is so convicted may, if it thinks fit, having regard to the age, character, antecedents or physical or mental condition
of the offender and to the trivial nature of the offence or any extenuating circumstances under which the offence was
committed, instead of sentencing him to any punishment, release him after due admonition.

   (4) An order under this section may be made by any Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session
when exercising its powers of revision.

    (5) When an order has been made under this section in respect of any offender, the High Court or Court of
Session may, on appeal when there is a right of appeal to such Court, or when exercising its powers of revision, set
aside such order, and in lieu thereof pass sentence on such offender according to law:

    Provided that the High Court or Court of Session shall not under this sub-section inflict a greater punishment
than might have been inflicted by the Court by which the offender was convicted.

    (6) The provisions of sections 121, 124 and 373 shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of sureties offered in
pursuance of the provisions of this section.

offender or his surety (if any) has a fixed place of abode or regular occupation in the place for which the Court acts
or in which the offender is likely to live during the period named for the observance of the conditions.

     (8) If the Court which convicted the offender, or a Court which could have dealt with the offender in respect of
his original offence, is satisfied that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of his recognizance, it
may issue a warrant for his apprehension.

     (9) An offender, when apprehended on any such warrant, shall be brought forthwith before the Court issuing the
warrant, and such Court may either remand him in custody until the case is heard or admit him to bail with a
sufficient surety conditioned on his appearing for sentence and such Court may, after hearing the case, pass
sentence.

    (10) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (20 of 1958), or
the Children Act, 1960 (60 of 1960) or any other law for the time being in force for the treatment, training or

    362. Court not to alter judgment.—Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any other law for the time
being in force, no Court, when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the
same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error.

     363. Copy of judgment to be given to the accused and other persons.—(1) When the accused is sentenced to
imprisonment, a copy of the judgment shall, immediately after the pronouncement of the judgment, be given to him
free of cost.

     (2) On the application of the accused, a certified copy of the judgment, or when he so desires, a translation in
his own language if practicable or in the language of the Court, shall be given to him without delay, and such copy
shall, in every case where the judgment is appealable by the accused, be given free of cost:

    Provided that where a sentence of death is passed or confirmed by the High Court, a certified copy of the
judgment shall be immediately given to the accused free of cost whether or not he applies for the same.

     (3) The provisions of sub-section (2) shall apply in relation to an order under section 117 as they apply in
relation to a judgment which is appealable by the accused.

   (4) When the accused is sentenced to death by any Court and an appeal lies from such judgment as of right, the
Court shall inform him of the period within which, if he wishes to appeal, his appeal should be preferred.

    (5) Save as otherwise provided in sub-section (2), any person affected by a judgment or order passed by a
Criminal Court shall, on an application made in this behalf and on payment of the prescribed charges, be given a
copy of such judgment or order or of any deposition or other part of the record:

    Provided that the Court may, if it thinks fit for some special reason, give it to him free of cost.

     (6) The High Court may, by rules, provide for the grant of copies of any judgment or order of a Criminal Court
to any person who is not affected by a judgment or order, on payment, by such person, of such fees, and subject to
such conditions, as the High Court may, by such rules, provide.

rank of Sub-Divisional Magistrate, who shall forward the same to the proper Appellate Court; and, when
any such appeal is presented to the Administrator or to an Executive Magistrate, he shall record thereon
the date of its date of presentation and, if he is satisfied that, by reason of the weather, transport or other
difficulties, it is not possible for the appellant to obtain, from the proper Appellate Court, orders for the
suspension of sentence or for bail, he may, in respect of such appeal, or an appeal forwarded to him under
section 383, exercise all or any of the powers of the proper Appellate Court and sub-section (1) of section
389 with regard to suspension of sentence or release of a convicted person on bail:

Union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Lakshadweep
   In section 383, the following words shall be inserted at the end, namely: —

record thereon the date of receipt thereof and thereafter forward the same to the proper Appellate Court.”.
    [Vide The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Regulation, 1974 Act (1 of 1974), s. 5.]

     384. Summary dismissal of appeal.—(1) If upon examining the petition of appeal and copy of the judgment
received under section 382 or section 383, the Appellate Court considers that there is no sufficient ground for
interfering, it may dismiss the appeal summarily:

    Provided that—

                                                        166
        (a) no appeal presented under section 382 shall be dismissed unless the appellant or his pleader has had a
    reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same;

         (b) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed except after giving the appellant a reasonable
    opportunity of being heard in support of the same, unless the Appellate Court considers that the appeal is
    frivolous or that the production of the accused in custody before the Court would involve such inconvenience as
    would be disproportionate in the circumstances of the case;

         (c) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed summarily until the period allowed for
    preferring such appeal has expired.

    (2) Before dismissing an appeal under this section, the Court may call for the record of the case.

    (3) Where the Appellate Court dismissing an appeal under this section is a Court of Session or of the Chief
Judicial Magistrate, it shall record its reasons for doing so.

     (4) Where an appeal presented under section 383 has been dismissed summarily under this section and the
Appellate Court finds that another petition of appeal duly presented under section 382 on behalf of the same
appellant has not been considered by it, that Court may, notwithstanding anything contained in section 393, if
satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice so to do, hear and dispose of such appeal in accordance with
law.

     385. Procedure for hearing appeals not dismissed summarily.—(1) If the Appellate Court does not dismiss
the appeal summarily, it shall cause notice of the time and place at which such appeal will be heard to be given—

         (i) to the appellant or his pleader;

         (ii) to such officer as the State Government may appoint in this behalf;

         (iii) if the appeal is from a judgment of conviction in a case instituted upon complaint, to the complainant;

       (iv) if the appeal is under section 377 or section 378, to the accused, and shall also furnish such officer,
    complainant and accused with a copy of the grounds of appeal.

   (2) The Appellate Court shall then send for the record of the case, if such record is not already available in that
Court, and hear the parties:

    Provided that if the appeal is only as to the extent or the legality of the sentence, the Court may dispose of the
appeal without sending for the record.

     (3) Where the only ground for appeal from a conviction is the alleged severity of the sentence, the appellant
shall not, except with the leave of the Court, urge or be heard in support of any other ground.

    386. Powers of the Appellate Court.—After perusing such record and hearing the appellant or his pleader, if
he appears, and the Public Prosecutor if he appears, and in case of an appeal under section 377 or section 378, the
accused, if he appears, the Appellate Court may, if it considers that there is no sufficient ground for interfering,
dismiss the appeal, or may—

         (a) in an appeal from an order or acquittal, reverse such order and direct that further inquiry be made, or
    that the accused be re-tried or committed for trial, as the case may be, or find him guilty and pass sentence on
    him according to law;

         (b) in an appeal from a conviction—

            (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a
         Court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to such Appellate Court or committed for trial, or

             (ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or

                                                          167
              (iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature or the extent, or the nature and extent, of the
          sentence, but not so as to enhance the same—

          (c) in an appeal for enhancement of sentence—

             (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be re-tried by a
          Court competent to try the offence, or

               (ii) alter the finding maintaining the sentence, or

               (iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature or the extent, or, the nature and extent, of the
          sentence, so as to enhance or reduce the same;

          (d) in an appeal from any other order, alter or reverse such order;

          (e) make any amendment or any consequential or incidental order that may be just or proper:

    Provided that the sentence shall not be enhanced unless the accused has had an opportunity of showing cause
against such enhancement:

    Provided further that the Appellate Court shall not inflict greater punishment for the offence which in its
opinion the accused has committed, than might have been inflicted for that offence by the Court passing the order or
sentence under appeal.
     387. Judgments of Subordinate Appellate Court.—The rules contained in Chapter XXVII as to the judgment
of a Criminal Court of original jurisdiction shall apply, so far as may be practicable, to the judgment in appeal of a
Court of Session or Chief Judicial Magistrate:
     Provided that, unless the Appellate Court otherwise directs, the accused shall not be brought up, or required to
attend, to hear judgment delivered.
    388. Order of High Court on appeal to be certified to lower Court.—(1) Whenever a case is decided on
appeal by the High Court under this Chapter, it shall certify its judgment or order to the Court by which the finding,
sentence or order appealed against was recorded or passed and if such Court is that of a Judicial Magistrate other
than the Chief Judicial Magistrate, the High Court's judgment or order shall be sent through the Chief Judicial
Magistrate, and if such Court is that of an Executive Magistrate, the High Court’s judgment or order shall be sent
through the District Magistrate.
    (2) The Court to which the High Court certifies its judgment or order shall thereupon make such orders as are
conformable to the judgment or order of the High Court; and if necessary, the record shall be amended in
accordance therewith.
     389. Suspension of sentence pending the appeal; release of appellant on bail.—(1) Pending any appeal by a
convicted person, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by it in writing, order that the execution of the
sentence or order appealed against be suspended and, also, if he is in confinement, that he be released on bail, or on
his own bond:
     1
     [Provided that the Appellate Court shall, before releasing on bail or on his own bond a convicted person who is
convicted of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten
years, shall give opportunity to the Public Prosecutor for showing cause in writing against such release:
    Provided further that in cases where a convicted person is released on bail it shall be open to the Public
Prosecutor to file an application for the cancellation of the bail.]
    (2) The power conferred by this section on a Appellate Court may be exercised also by the High Court in the
case of an appeal by a convicted person to a Court subordinate thereto.
     (3) Where the convicted person satisfies the Court by which he is convicted that he intends to present an appeal,
the Court shall,—

1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 33 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).
                                                            168
         (i) where such person, being on bail, is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or
         (ii) where the offence of which such person has been convicted is a bailable one, and he is on bail,
order that the convicted person be released on bail, unless there are special reasons for refusing bail, for such period as
will afford sufficient time to present the appeal and obtain the orders of the Appellate Court under sub-section (1); and
the sentence of imprisonment shall, so long as he is so released on bail, be deemed to be suspended.
    (4) When the appellant is ultimately sentenced to imprisonment for a term or to imprisonment for life, the time
during which he is so released shall be excluded in computing the term for which he is so sentenced.
      390. Arrest of accused in appeal from acquittal.—When an appeal is presented under section 378, the High
Court may issue a warrant directing that the accused be arrested and brought before it or any Subordinate Court, and
the Court before which he is brought may commit him to prison pending the disposal of the appeal or admit him to
bail.
    391. Appellate Court may take further evidence or direct it to be taken.—(1) In dealing with any appeal
under this Chapter, the Appellate Court, if it thinks additional evidence to be necessary, shall record its reasons and
may either take such evidence itself, or direct it to be taken by a Magistrate or, when the Appellate Court is a High
Court, by a Court of Session or a Magistrate.
    (2) When the additional evidence is taken by the Court of Session or the Magistrate, it or he shall certify such
evidence to the Appellate Court, and such Court shall thereupon proceed to dispose of the appeal.

    (3) The accused or his pleader shall have the right to be present when the additional evidence is taken.

    (4) The taking of evidence under this section shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter XXIII, as if it were an
inquiry.

     392. Procedure where Judges of Court of Appeal are equally divided.—When an appeal under this Chapter
is heard by a High Court before a Bench of Judges and they are divided in opinion, the appeal, with their opinions,
shall be laid before another Judge of that Court, and that Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit, shall deliver his
opinion, and the judgment or order shall follow that opinion:

    Provided that if one of the Judges constituting the Bench, or, where the appeal is laid before another Judge
under this section, that Judge, so requires, the appeal shall be re-heard and decided by a larger Bench of Judges.

    393. Finality of judgments and orders on appeal.—Judgments and orders passed by an Appellate Court upon
an appeal shall be final, except in the cases provided for in section 377, section 378, sub-section (4) of section 384
or Chapter XXX:

   Provided that notwithstanding the final disposal of an appeal against conviction in any case, the Appellate Court
may hear and dispose of, on the merits,—

         (a) an appeal against acquittal under section 378, arising out of the same case, or

         (b) an appeal for the enhancement of sentence under section 377, arising out of the same case.

    394. Abatement of appeals.—(1) Every other appeal under section 377 or section 378 shall finally abate on the
death of the accused.

    (2) Every other appeal under this Chapter (except an appeal from a sentence of fine) shall finally abate on the
death of the appellant:

    Provided that where the appeal is against a conviction and sentence of death or of imprisonment, and the
appellant dies during the pendency of the appeal, any of his near relatives may, within thirty days of the death of the
appellant, apply to the Appellate Court for leave to continue the appeal; and if leave is granted, the appeal shall not
abate.

    Explanation.—In this section, “near relative” means a parent, spouse, lineal descendant, brother or sister.

    395. Reference to High Court.—(1) Where any Court is satisfied that a case pending before it involves a
question as to the validity of any Act, Ordinance or Regulation or of any provision contained in an Act, Ordinance
or Regulation, the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, and is of opinion that such Act,
Ordinance, Regulation or provision is invalid or inoperative, but has not been so declared by the High Court to
which that Court is Subordinate or by the Supreme Court, the Court shall state a case setting out its opinion and the
reasons therefor, and refer the same for the decision of the High Court.

    Explanation.—In this section, “Regulation” means any Regulation as defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897
(10 of 1897), or in the General Clauses Act of a State.

    (2) A Court of Session or a Metropolitan Magistrate may, if it or he thinks fit in any case pending before it or

law arising in the hearing of such case.

    (3) Any Court making a reference to the High Court under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) may, pending the
decision of the High Court thereon, either commit the accused to jail or release him on bail to appear when called
upon.

    396. Disposal of case according to decision of High Court.—(1) When a question has been so referred, the

    (2) The High Court may direct by whom the costs of such reference shall be paid.

     397. Calling for records to exercise powers of revision.—(1) The High Court or any Sessions Judge may call

jurisdiction for the purpose of satisfying itself or himself; to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding,
sentence or order, recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of such inferior Court, and may,
when calling, for such record, direct that the execution of any sentence or order be suspended, and if the accused is
in confinement that he be released on bail or on his own bond pending the examination of the record.

     Explanation.—All Magistrates, whether Executive or Judicial, and whether exercising original or appellate
jurisdiction, shall be deemed to be inferior to the Sessions Judge for the purposes of this sub-section and of
section 398.

order passed in any appeal, inquiry, trial or other proceeding.
    (3) If an application under this section has been made by any person either to the High Court or to the Sessions
Judge, no further application by the same person shall be entertained by the other of them.

Sessions Judge may direct the Chief Judicial Magistrate by himself or by any of the Magistrates subordinate to him
to make, and the Chief Judicial Magistrate may himself make or direct any subordinate Magistrate to make, further
inquiry into any complaint which has been dismissed under section 203 or sub-section (4) of section 204, or into the
case of any person accused of an offence who has been discharged:
    Provided that no Court shall make any direction under this section for inquiry into the case of any person who
has been discharged unless such person has had an opportunity of showing cause why such direction should not be
made.
     399. Sessions Judge's powers of revision.—(1) In the case of any proceeding the record of which has been
called for by himself, the Sessions Judge may exercise all or any of the powers which may be exercised by the High

                                                         170
Court under sub-section (1) of section 401.
     (2) Where any proceeding by way of revision is commenced before a Sessions Judge under sub-section (1), the
provisions of sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of section 401 shall, so far as may be, apply to such proceeding and
references in the said sub-sections to the High Court shall be construed as references to the Sessions Judge.
     (3) Where any application for revision is made by or on behalf of any person before the Sessions Judge, the
decision of the Sessions Judge thereon in relation to such person shall be final and no further proceeding by way of
revision at the instance of such person shall be entertained by the High Court or any other Court.
    400. Power of Additional Sessions Judge.—An Additional Sessions Judge shall have and may exercise all the
powers of a Sessions Judge under this Chapter in respect of any case which may be transferred to him by or under
any general or special order of the Sessions Judge.
     401. High Court's powers of revision.—(1) In the case of any proceeding the record of which has been called
for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, the High Court may, in its discretion, exercise any of the
powers conferred on a Court of Appeal by sections 386, 389, 390 and 391 or on a Court of Session by section 307,
and, when the Judges composing the Court of Revision are equally divided in opinion, the case shall be disposed of
in the manner provided by section 392.
    (2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the accused or other person unless he has had
an opportunity of being heard either personally or by pleader in his own defence.

    (3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one
conviction.

    (4) Where under this Code an appeal lies and no appeal is brought, no proceeding by way of revision shall be
entertained at the instance of the party who could have appealed.

     (5) Where under this Code an appeal lies but an application for revision has been made to the High Court by
any person and the High Court is satisfied that such application was made under the erroneous belief that no appeal
lies thereto and that it is necessary in the interests of Justice so to do, the High Court may treat the application for
revision as a petition of appeal and deal with the same accordingly.

     402. Power of High Court to withdraw or transfer revision cases.—(1) Whenever one or more persons
convicted at the same trial makes or make application to a High Court for revision and any other person convicted at
the same trial makes an application to the Sessions Judge for revision, the High Court shall decide, having regard to the
general convenience of the parties and the importance of the questions involved, which of the two Courts should
finally dispose of the applications for revision and when the High Court decides that all the applications for revision
should be disposed of by itself, the High Court shall direct that the applications for revision pending before the
Sessions Judge be transferred to itself and where the High Court decides that it is not necessary for it to dispose of the
applications for revision, it shall direct that the applications for revision made to it be transferred to the Sessions Judge.

     (2) Whenever any application for revision is transferred to the High Court, that Court shall deal with the same
as if it were an application duly made before itself.

   (3) Whenever any application for revision is transferred to the Sessions Judge, that Judge shall deal with the
same as if it were an application duly made before himself.

    (4) Where an application for revision is transferred by the High Court to the Sessions Judge, no further
application for revision shall lie to the High Court or to any other Court at the instance of the person or persons
whose applications for revision have been disposed of by the Sessions Judge.

     403. Option of Court to hear parties.—Save as otherwise expressly provided by this Code, no party has any
right to be heard either personally or by pleader before any Court exercising its powers of revision; but the Court
may, if it thinks fit, when exercising such powers, hear any party either personally or by pleader.

                                                            171
    404. Statement by Metropolitan Magistrate of grounds of his decision to be considered by High Court.—
When the record of any trial held by a Metropolitan Magistrate is called for by the High Court or Court of Session
under section 397, the Magistrate may submit with the record a statement setting forth the grounds of his decision or
order and any facts which he thinks material to the issue, and that Court shall consider such statement before
overruling or setting aside the said decision or order.

    405. High Court's order to be certified to lower Court.—When a case is revised under this Chapter by the
High Court or a Sessions Judge, it or he shall, in the manner provided by section 388, certify its decision or order to
the Court by which the finding, sentence or order revised was recorded or passed, and the Court to which the
decision or order is so certified shall thereupon make such orders as are conformable to the decision so certified,
and, if necessary, the record shall be amended in accordance therewith.

    406. Power of Supreme Court to transfer cases and appeals.—(1) Whenever it is made to appear to the
Supreme Court that an order under this section is expedient for the ends of justice, it may direct that any particular
case or appeal be transferred from one High Court to another High Court or from a Criminal Court subordinate to
one High Court to another Criminal Court of equal or superior jurisdiction subordinate to another High Court.

     (2) The Supreme Court may act under this section only on the application of the Attorney-General of India or
of a party interested, and every such application shall be made by motion, which shall, except when the applicant is
the Attorney-General of India or the Advocate-General of the State, be supported by affidavit or affirmation.

    (3) Where any application for the exercise of the powers conferred by this section is dismissed, the Supreme
Court may, if it is of opinion that the application was frivolous or vexatious, order the applicant to pay by way of
compensation to any person who has opposed the application such sum not exceeding one thousand rupees as it may
consider appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

   407. Power of High Court to transfer cases and appeals.—(1) Whenever it is made to appear to the High

         (b) that some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise, or

        (c) that an order under this section is required by any provision of this Code, or will tend to the general
    convenience of the parties or witnesses, or is expedient for the ends of justice,

it may order—

         (i) that any offence be inquired into or tried by any Court not qualified under sections 177 to 185 (both
    inclusive), but in other respects competent to inquire into or try such offence;

        (ii) that any particular case or appeal, or class of cases or appeals, be transferred from a Criminal Court
    subordinate to its authority to any other such Criminal Court of equal or superior jurisdiction;

         (iii) that any particular case be committed for trial to a Court of Session; or

         (iv) that any particular case or appeal be transferred to and tried before itself.

     (2) The High Court may act either on the report of the lower Court, or on the application of a party interested, or
on its own initiative:

    Provided that no application shall lie to the High Court for transferring a case from one Criminal Court to

                                                           172
another Criminal Court in the same sessions division, unless an application for such transfer has been made to the
Sessions Judge and rejected by him.

    (3) Every application for an order under sub-section (1) shall be made by motion, which shall, except when the
applicant is the Advocate-General of the State, be supported by affidavit or affirmation.

    (4) When such application is made by an accused person, the High Court may direct him to execute
a bond, with or without sureties, for the payment of any compensation which the High Court may award under
sub-section (7).

    (5) Every accused person making such application shall give to the Public Prosecutor notice in writing of the
application, together with a copy of the grounds on which it is made; and no order shall be made on the merits of the
applications unless at least twenty-four hours have elapsed between the giving of such notice and the hearing of the
application.

     (6) Where the application is for the transfer of a case or appeal from any Subordinate Court, the High Court
may, if it is satisfied that it is necessary so to do in the interest of Justice, order that, pending the disposal of the
application the proceedings in the Subordinate Court shall be stayed, on such terms as the High Court may think fit
to impose:

    Provided that such stay shall not affect the Subordinate Court’s power of remand under section 309.

      (7) Where an application for an order under sub-section (1) is dismissed, the High Court may, if it is of opinion
that the application was frivolous or vexatious, order the applicant to pay by way of compensation to any person
who has opposed the application such sum not exceeding one thousand rupees as it may consider proper in the
circumstances of the case.

     (8) When the High Court orders under sub-section (1) that a case be transferred from any Court for trial before
itself, it shall observe in such trial the same procedure which that Court would have observed if the case had not
been so transferred.

    (9) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any order of Government under section 197.

     408. Power of Sessions Judge to transfer cases and appeals.—(1) Whenever it is made to appear to a

    (3) The provisions of sub-sections (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (9) of section 407 shall apply in relation to an
application to the Sessions Judge for an order under sub-section (1) as they apply in relation to an application to the
High Court for an order under sub-section (1) of section 407, except that sub-section (7) of that section shall so
apply as if for the words “one thousand rupees” occurring therein, the words “two hundred and fifty rupees” were
substituted.

    421. Warrant for levy of fine.—(1) When an offender has been sentenced to pay a fine, the Court passing the
sentence may take action for the recovery of the fine in either or both of the following ways, that is to say, it may—
         (a) issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by attachment and sale of any movable property belonging to
    the offender;
        (b) issue a warrant to the Collector of the district, authorising him to realise the amount as arrears of land
    revenue from the movable or immovable property, or both, of the defaulter:
     Provided that, if the sentence directs that in default of payment of the fine, the offender shall be imprisoned, and
if such offender has undergone the whole of such imprisonment in default, no Court shall issue such warrant unless,
for special reasons to be recorded in writing, it considers it necessary so to do, or unless it has made an order for the
payment of expenses or compensation out of the fine under section 357.
     (2) The State Government may make rules regulating the manner in which warrants under clause (a) of
sub-section (1) are to be executed, and for the summary determination of any claims made by any person other than
the offender in respect of any property attached in execution of such warrant.
     (3) Where the Court issues a warrant to the Collector under clause (b) of sub-section (1), the Collector shall
realise the amount in accordance with the law relating to recovery of arrears of land revenue, as if such warrant were

jurisdiction such property is found.
    423. Warrant for levy of fine issued by a Court in any territory to which this Code does not extend.—
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Code or in any other law for the time being in force, when an offender
has been sentenced to pay a fine by a Criminal Court in any territory to which this Code does not extend and the
Court passing the sentence issues a warrant to the Collector of a district in the territories to which this Code extends,
authorising him to realise the amount as if it were an arrear of land revenue, such warrant shall be deemed to be a
warrant issued under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 421 by a Court in the territories to which this Code
extends, and the provisions of sub-section (3) of the said section as to the execution of such warrant shall apply
accordingly.

     424. Suspension of execution of sentence of imprisonment.—(1) When an offender has been sentenced to
fine only and to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine, and the fine is not paid forthwith, the Court may—

         (a) order that the fine shall be payable either in full on or before a date not more than thirty days from the
    date of the order, or in two or three instalments, of which the first shall be payable on or before a date not more
    than thirty days from the date of the order and the other or others at an interval or at intervals, as the case may
    be, of not more than thirty days;

        (b) suspend the execution of the sentence of imprisonment and release the offender, on the execution by the
    offender of a bond, with or without sureties, as the Court thinks fit, conditioned for his appearance before the
    Court on the date or dates on or before which payment of the fine or the instalments thereof, as the case may be,

                                                          176
     is to be made; and if the amount of the fine or of any instalment, as the case may be, is not realised on or before
     the latest date on which it is payable under the order, the Court may direct the sentence of imprisonment to be
     carried into execution at once.

     (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall be applicable also in any case in which an order for the payment of
money has been made on non-recovery of which imprisonment may be awarded and the money is not paid
forthwith; and, if the person against whom the order has been made, on being required to enter into a bond such as is
referred to in that sub-section, fails to do so, the Court may at once pass sentence of imprisonment.

                                     D.—General provisions regarding execution
    425. Who may issue warrant.—Every warrant for the execution of a sentence may be issued either by the
Judge or Magistrate who passed the sentence, or by his successor-in-office.

or fine is passed under this Code on an escaped convict, such sentence shall, subject to the provisions hereinbefore
contained, take effect immediately.

     (2) When a sentence of imprisonment for a term is passed under this Code on an escaped convict,—

         (a) if such sentence is severer in kind than the sentence which such convict was undergoing when he
     escaped, the new sentence shall take effect immediately;

         (b) if such sentence is not severer in kind than the sentence which such convict was undergoing when he
     escaped, the new sentence shall take effect after he has suffered imprisonment for a further period equal to that
     which, at the time of his escape, remained unexpired of his former sentence.

    (3) For the purposes of sub-section (2), a sentence of rigorous imprisonment shall be deemed to be severer in
kind than a sentence of simple imprisonment.

    427. Sentence on offender already sentenced for another offence.—(1) When a person already undergoing a
sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction to imprisonment or imprisonment for life, such
imprisonment or imprisonment for life shall commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been
previously sentenced, unless the Court directs that the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with such previous
sentence:

     Provided that where a person who has been sentenced to imprisonment by an order under section 122 in default
of furnishing security is, whilst undergoing such sentence, sentenced to imprisonment for an offence committed
prior to the making of such order, the latter sentence shall commence immediately.

    (2) When a person already undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for life is sentenced on a subsequent
conviction to imprisonment for a term or imprisonment for life, the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with
such previous sentence.

     428. Period of detention undergone by the accused to be set off against the sentence of imprisonment.—
Where an accused person has, on conviction, been sentenced to imprisonment for a term, 1[, not being imprisonment
in default of payment of fine], the period of detention, if any, undergone by him during the investigation, inquiry or
trial of the same case and before the date of such conviction, shall be set off against the term of imprisonment
imposed on him on such conviction, and the liability of such person to undergo imprisonment on such conviction
shall be restricted to the remainder, if any, of the term of imprisonment imposed on him:
     2
     [Provided that in cases referred to in section 433A, such period of detention shall be set off against the period
of fourteen years referred to in that section.]

punishment to which he is liable upon his former or subsequent conviction.

     (2) When an award of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine is annexed to a substantive sentence of
imprisonment and the person undergoing the sentence is after its execution to undergo a further substantive sentence
or further substantive sentences of imprisonment, effect shall not be given to the award of imprisonment in default
of payment of the fine until the person has undergone the further sentence or sentences.

     430. Return of warrant on execution of sentence.—When a sentence has been fully executed, the officer
executing it shall return the warrant to the Court from which it is issued, with an endorsement under his hand

any order made under this Code, and the method of recovery of which is not otherwise expressly provided for, shall
be recoverable as if it were a fine:

    Provided that section 421 shall, in its application to an order under section 359, by virtue of this section, be
construed as if in the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 421, after the words and figures “under section 357”, the
words and figures “or an order for payment of costs under section 359” had been inserted.

                              E.—Suspension, remission and commutation of sentences
    432. Power to suspend or remit sentences.—(1) When any person has been sentenced to punishment for an
offence, the appropriate Government may, at any time, without conditions or upon any conditions which the person
sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which
he has been sentenced.

     (2) Whenever an application is made to the appropriate Government for the suspension or remission of a

                                               PROVISIONS AS TO BAIL AND BONDS
    436. In what cases bail to be taken.—(1) When any person other than a person accused of a non-bailable
offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station, or appears or is brought
before a Court, and is prepared at any time while in the custody of such officer or at any stage of the proceeding
before such Court to give bail, such person shall be released on bail:
     Provided that such officer or Court, if he or it thinks fit, 1[may, and shall, if such person is indigent and is
unable to furnish surety, instead of taking bail] from such person, discharge him on his executing a bond without
sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided.
     2
      [Explanation.—Where a person is unable to give bail within a week of the date of his arrest, it shall be a
sufficient ground for the officer or the Court to presume that he is an indigent person for the purposes of this
proviso:]
     Provided further that nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of sub-section (3) of
section 116 3[or section 446A].
     (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where a person has failed to comply with the
conditions of the bail-bond as regards the time and place of attendance, the Court may refuse to release him on bail,
when on a subsequent occasion in the same case he appears before the Court or is brought in custody and any such
refusal shall be without prejudice to the powers of the Court to call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the
penalty thereof under section 446.
     4
     [436A. Maximum period for which an undertrial prisoner can be detained.—Where a person has, during
the period of investigation, inquiry or trial under this Code of an offence under any law (not being an offence for
which the punishment of death has been specified as one of the punishments under that law) undergone detention for
a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence under that law,
he shall be released by the Court on his personal bond with or without sureties:
     Provided that the Court may, after hearing the Public Prosecutor and for reasons to be recorded by it in writing,
order the continued detention of such person for a period longer than one-half of the said period or release him on
bail instead of the personal bond with or without sureties:
      Provided further that no such person shall in any case be detained during the period of investigation, inquiry or
trial for more than the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the said offence under that law.
    Explanation.—In computing the period of detention under this section for granting bail, the period of detention
passed due to delay in proceeding caused by the accused shall be excluded.]

    437. When bail may be taken in case of non-bailable offence.—5[(1) When any person accused of, or
suspected of, the commission of any non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in
charge of a police station or appears or is brought before a Court other than the High Court or Court of session, he
may be released on bail, but—

          (i) such person shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been
     guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life;

         (ii) such person shall not be so released if such offence is a cognizable offence and he had been previously
     convicted of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for seven years or more,

     or he had been previously convicted on two or more occasions of 1[a cognizable offence punishable with
     imprisonment for three years or more but not less than seven years:]

    Provided that the Court may direct that a person referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) be released on bail if such
person is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman or is sick or infirm:

     Provided further that the Court may also direct that a person referred to in clause (ii) be released on bail if it is
satisfied that it is just and proper so to do for any other special reason:

    Provided also that the mere fact that an accused person may be required for being identified by witnesses during
investigation shall not be sufficient ground for refusing to grant bail if he is otherwise entitled to be released on bail
and gives an undertaking that he shall comply with such directions as may be given by the Court:]
     2
     [Provided also that no person shall, if the offence alleged to have been committed by him is punishable with
death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or more, be released on bail by the Court under this
sub-section without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Public Prosecutor.]

     (2) If it appears to such officer or Court at any stage of the investigation, inquiry or trial, as the case may be,
that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed a non-bailable offence, but that
there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, 3[the accused shall, subject to the provisions of section
446A and pending such inquiry, be released on bail], or, at the discretion of such officer or Court, on the execution
by him of a bond without sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided.

    (3) When a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment which
may extend to seven years or more or of an offence under Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abatement of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offence, is released on bail
under sub-section (1), 4[the Court shall impose the conditions,—

          (a) that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter,

          (b) that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, or suspected,
     of the commission of which he is suspected, and

          (c) that such person shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person
     acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any
     police officer or tamper with the evidence,

and may also impose, in the interests of justice, such other conditions as it considers necessary.]

     (4) An officer or a Court releasing any person on bail under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), shall record in
writing his or its 5[reasons or special reasons] for so doing.

     (5) Any Court which has released a person on bail under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), may, if it considers
it necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested and commit him to custody.

     (6) If, in any case triable by a Magistrate, the trial of a person accused of any non-bailable offence is not
concluded within a period of sixty days from the first date fixed for taking evidence in the case, such person shall, if
he is in custody during the whole of the said period, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, unless
for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise directs.

     (7) If, at any time, after the conclusion of the trial of a person accused of a non-bailable offence and before
judgment is delivered, the Court is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not
guilty of any such offence, it shall release the accused, if he is in custody, on the execution by him of a bond without
sureties for his appearance to hear judgment delivered.
     1
         [437A. Bail to require accused to appear before next appellate Court.—(1) Before conclusion of the trial

require the accused to execute bail bonds with sureties, to appear before the higher Court as and when such Court
issues notice in respect of any appeal or petition filed against the judgment of the respective Court and such bail
bonds shall be in force for six months.

     (2) If such accused fails to appear, the bond stand forfeited and the procedure under section 446 shall apply.]

     438. Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest.—(1) When any person has reason to believe

Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section; and that Court may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the
event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail.

     (2) When the High Court or the Court of Session makes a direction under sub-section (1), it may include such
conditions in such directions in the light of the facts of the particular case, as it may think fit, including—

     any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or

            (iii) a condition that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court;

            (iv) such other condition as may be imposed under sub-section (3) of section 437, as if the bail were

accusation, and is prepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail,
he shall be released on bail; and if a Magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that a warrant should be
issued in the first instance against that person, he shall issue a bailable warrant in confirmity with the direction of the
Court under sub-section (1).

release to the officer in charge of the jail, and such officer on receipt of the orders shall release him.

        (2) Nothing in this section, section 436 or section 437, shall be deemed to require the release of any person
liable to be detained for some matter other than that in respect of which the bond was executed.
     443. Power to order sufficient bail when that first taken is insufficient.—If, through mistake, fraud or
otherwise, insufficient sureties have been accepted, or if they afterwards become insufficient, the Court may issue a

sureties, and, on his failing so to do, may commit him to jail.

   [Vide West Bengal Act 24 of 2003, s. 4.]
    446. Procedure when bond has been forfeited.—(1) Where a bond under this Code is for appearance, or for
production of property, before a Court and it is proved to the satisfaction of that Court, or of any Court to which the
case has subsequently been transferred, that the bond has been forfeited,
    or where, in respect of any other bond under this Code, it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court by which the
bond was taken, or of any Court to which the case has subsequently been transferred, or of the Court of any
Magistrate of the first class, that the bond has been forfeited,
    the Court shall record the grounds of such proof, and may call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the
penalty thereof or to show cause why it should not be paid.
    Explanation.—A condition in a bond for appearance, or for production of property, before a Court shall be
construed as including a condition for appearance, or as the case may be, for production of property, before any
                                                          186
Court to which the case may subsequently be transferred.
    (2) If sufficient cause is not shown and the penalty is not paid, the Court may proceed to recover the same as if
such penalty were a fine imposed by it under this Code:
     1
       [Provided that where such penalty is not paid and cannot be recovered in the manner aforesaid, the person so
bound as surety shall be liable, by order of the Court ordering the recovery of the penalty, to imprisonment in civil
jail for a term which may extend to six months.]
    (3) The Court may, 2[after recording its reasons for doing so], remit any portion of the penalty mentioned and
enforce payment in part only.
    (4) Where a surety to a bond dies before the bond is forfeited, his estate shall be discharged from all liability in
respect of the bond.
     (5) Where any person who has furnished security under section 106 or section 117 or section 360 is convicted
of an offence the commission of which constitutes a breach of the conditions of his bond, or of a bond executed in
lieu of his bond under section 448, a certified copy of the judgment of the Court by which he was convicted of such
offence may be used as evidence in proceedings under this section against his surety or sureties, and, if such
certified copy is so used, the Court shall presume that such offence was committed by him unless the contrary is
proved.
     3
     [446A. Cancellation of bond and bail bond.—Without prejudice to the provisions of section 446, where a
bond under this Code is for appearance of a person in a case and it is forfeited for breach of a condition,—
          (a) the bond executed by such person as well as the bond, if any, executed by one or more of his sureties in
     that case shall stand cancelled; and
          (b) thereafter no such person shall be released only on his own bond in that case, if the Police Officer or the
     Court, as the case may be, for appearance before whom the bond was executed, is satisfied that there was no
     sufficient cause for the failure of the person bound by the bond to comply with its condition:
     Provided that subject to any other provisions of this Code he may be released in that case upon the execution of
a fresh personal bond for such sum of money and bond by one or more of such sureties as the Police Officer or the
Court, as the case may be, thinks sufficient.]
    447. Procedure in case of insolvency of death of surety or when a bond is forfeited.—When any surety to a
bond under this Code becomes insolvent or dies, or when any bond is forfeited under the provisions of section 446,
the Court by whose order such bond was taken, or a Magistrate of the first class may order the person from whom
such security was demanded to furnish fresh securities in accordance with the directions of the original order, and if
such security is not furnished, such Court or Magistrate may proceed as if there had been a default in complying
with such original order.
    448. Bond required from minor.—When the person required by any Court, or officer to execute a bond is a
minor, such Court or officer may accept, in lieu thereof, a bond executed by a surety or sureties only.
     449. Appeal from orders under section 446.—All orders passed under section 446 shall be appealable,—
          (i) in the case of an order made by a Magistrate, to the Sessions Judge;
        (ii) in the case of an order made by a Court of Session, to the Court to which an appeal lies from an order

                                               CHAPTER XXXIV
                                             DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY
     451. Order for custody and disposal of property pending trial in certain cases.—When any property is
produced before any Criminal Court during any inquiry or trial, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for
the proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and, if the property is subject to
speedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it
thinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of.
    Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “property” includes—
         (a) property of any kind or document which is produced before the Court or which is in its custody;
        (b) any property regarding which an offence appears to have been committed or which appears to have
    been used for the commission of any offence.
      452. Order for disposal of property at conclusion of trial.—(1) When an inquiry or trial in any Criminal
Court is concluded, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal, by destruction, confiscation or
delivery to any person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise, of any property or document
produced before it or in its custody, or regarding which any offence appears to have been committed, or which has
been used for the commission of any offence.

     (2) An order may be made under sub-section (1) for the delivery of any property to any person claiming to be
entitled to the possession thereof, without any condition or on condition that he executes a bond, with or without
securities, to the satisfaction of the Court, engaging to restore such property to the Court if the order made under
sub-section (1) is modified or set aside on appeal or revision.

     (3) A Court of Session may, instead of itself making an order under sub-section (1), direct the property to be
delivered to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall thereupon deal with it in the manner provided in sections 457,
458 and 459.

    (4) Except where the property is livestock or is subject to speedy and natural decay, or where a bond has been
executed in pursuance of sub-section (2), an order made under sub-section (1) shall not be carried out for two
months, or when an appeal is presented, until such appeal has been disposed of.

     (5) In this section, the term “property” includes, in the case of property regarding which an offence appears to
have been committed, not only such property as has been originally in the possession or under the control of any
party, but also any property into or for which the same may have been converted or exchanged, and anything
acquired by such conversion or exchange, whether immediately or otherwise.

     453. Payment to innocent purchaser of money found on accused.—When any person is convicted of any
offence which includes, or amounts to, theft or receiving stolen property, and it is proved that any other person
bought the stolen property from him without knowing or having reason to believe that the same was stolen, and
that any money has on his arrest been taken out of the possession of the convicted person, the Court may, on the
application of such purchaser and on the restitution of the stolen property to the person entitled to the possession
thereof, order that out of such money a sum not exceeding the price paid by such purchaser be delivered to him.

    454. Appeal against orders under section 452 or section 453.—(1) Any person aggrieved by an order made
by a Court under section 452 or section 453, may appeal against it to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from
convictions by the former Court.

   (2) On such appeal, the Appellate Court may direct the order to be stayed pending disposal of the appeal, or
may modify, alter or annul the order and make any further orders that may be just.

     (3) The powers referred to in sub-section (2) may also be exercised by a Court of appeal, confirmation or
revision while dealing with the case in which the order referred to in sub-section (1) was made.

    455. Destruction of libellous and other matter.—(1) On a conviction under section 292, section 293, section
501 or section 502 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the Court may order the destruction of all the copies of the
                                                        188
thing in respect of which the conviction was had, and which are in the custody of the Court or remain in the
possession or power of the person convicted.

     (2) The Court may, in like manner, on a conviction under section 272, section 273, section 274 or section 275 of
the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), order the food, drink, drug or medical preparation in respect of which the
conviction was had, to be destroyed.

      456. Power to restore possession of immovable property.—(1) When a person is convicted of an offence
attended by criminal force or show of force or by criminal intimidation, and it appears to the Court that, by such
force or show of force or intimidation, any person has been dispossessed of any immovable property, the Court may,
if it thinks fit, order that possession of the same be restored to that person after evicting by force, if necessary, any
other person who may be in possession of the property:

     Provided that no such order shall be made by the Court more than one month after the date of the conviction.

     (2) Where the Court trying the offence has not made an order under sub-section (1), the Court of appeal,
confirmation or revision may, if it thinks fit, make such order while disposing of the appeal, reference or revision, as
the case may be.

     (3) Where an order has been made under sub-section (1), the provisions of section 454 shall apply in relation
thereto as they apply in relation to an order under section 453.

    (4) No order made under this section shall prejudice any right or interest to or in such immovable property
which any person may be able to establish in a civil suit.
     457. Procedure by police upon seizure of property.—(1) Whenever the seizure of property by any police
officer is reported to a Magistrate under the provisions of this Code, and such property is not produced before a
Criminal Court during an inquiry or trial, the Magistrate may make such order as he thinks fit respecting the disposal
of such property or the delivery of such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof, or if such person
cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of such property.
     (2) If the person so entitled is known, the Magistrate may order the property to be delivered to him on such
conditions (if any) as the Magistrate thinks fit and if such person is unknown, the Magistrate may detain it and shall,
in such case, issue a proclamation specifying the articles of which such property consists, and requiring any person
who may have a claim thereto, to appear before him and establish his claim within six months from the date of such
proclamation.
     458. Procedure where no claimant appears within six months.—(1) If no person within such period
establishes his claim to such property, and if the person in whose possession such property was found is unable to
show that it was legally acquired by him, the Magistrate may by order direct that such property shall be at the
disposal of the State Government and may be sold by that Government and the proceeds of such sale shall be dealt
with in such manner as may be prescribed.
    (2) An appeal shall lie against any such order to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from convictions by
the Magistrate.
     459. Power to sell perishable property.—If the person entitled to the possession of such property is unknown
or absent and the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if the Magistrate to whom its seizure is reported
is of opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of the owner, or that the value of such property is 1[less than five
hundred rupees], the Magistrate may at any time direct it to be sold; and the provisions of sections 457 and 458
shall, as nearly as may be practicable, apply to the net proceeds of such sale.
                                                       CHAPTER XXXV
                                                  IRREGULAR PROCEEDINGS
     460. Irregularities which do not vitiate proceedings.—If any Magistrate not empowered by law to do any of
the following things, namely:—


1. Subs. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 41, for “less than ten rupees” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006).
                                                                189

    has committed an offence outside the limits of such jurisdiction;
         (e) to take cognizance of an offence under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 190;

         (g) to tender a pardon under section 306;
         (h) to recall a case and try it himself under section 410; or
         (i) to sell property under section 458 or section 459,
erroneously in good faith does that thing, his proceedings shall not be set aside merely on the ground of his not
being so empowered.
    461. Irregularities which vitiate proceedings.—If any Magistrate, not being empowered by law in this behalf,
does any of the following things, namely:—
         (a) attaches and sells property under section 83;
        (b) issues a search-warrant for a document, parcel or other things in the custody of a postal or telegraph
    authority;

his proceedings shall be void.
     462. Proceedings in wrong place.—No finding, sentence or order of any Criminal Court shall be set aside
merely on the ground that the inquiry, trial or other proceedings in the course of which it was arrived at or passed,
took place in a wrong sessions division, district, sub-division or other local area, unless it appears that such error has
in fact occasioned a failure of justice.
    463. Non-compliance with provisions of section 164 or section 281.—(1) If any Court before which a
                                                             190
confession or other statement of an accused person recorded, or purporting to be recorded under section 164 or
section 281, is tendered, or has been received, in evidence finds that any of the provisions of either of such sections
have not been complied with by the Magistrate recording the statement, it may, notwithstanding anything contained
in section 91 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), take evidence in regard to such non-compliance, and
may, if satisfied that such non-compliance has not injured the accused in his defence on the merits and that he duly
made the statement recorded, admit such statement.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply to Courts of appeal, reference and revision.
    464. Effect of omission to frame, or absence of, or error in, charge.—(1) No finding, sentence or order by a
Court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the
ground of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge including any misjoinder of charges, unless, in the
opinion of the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.
    (2) If the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, is of opinion that a failure of justice has in fact been
occasioned, it may,—
        (a) in the case of an omission to frame a charge, order that a charge be framed, and that the trial be
    recommended from the point immediately after the framing of the charge;
        (b) in the case of an error, omission or irregularity in the charge, direct a new trial to be had upon a charge
    framed in whatever manner it thinks fit:

    Provided that if the Court is of opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could be preferred
against the accused in respect of the facts proved, it shall quash the conviction.

     465. Finding or sentence when reversible by reason of error, omission or irregularity.—(1) Subject to the
provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be
reversed or altered by a Court of appeal, confirmation of revision on account of any error, omission or irregularity in
the complaint, summons, warrant, proclamation, order, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or
in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code, or any error, or irregularity in any sanction for the
prosecution, unless in the opinion of that Court, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.

     (2) In determining whether any error, omission or irregularity in any proceeding under this Code, or any error,
or irregularity in any sanction for the prosecution has occasioned a failure of justice, the Court shall have regard to
the fact whether the objection could and should have been raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings.

    466. Defect or error not to make attachment unlawful.—No attachment made under this Code shall be
deemed unlawful, nor shall any person making the same be deemed a trespasser, on account of any defect or want of
form in the summons, conviction, writ of attachment or other proceedings relating thereto.

          (b) one year, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year;

         (c) three years, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding one year but not

     469. Commencement of the period of limitation.—(1) The period of limitation, in relation to an offender,
shall commence,—

          (a) on the date of the offence; or

     police officer, the first day on which such offence comes to the knowledge of such person or to any police
     officer, whichever is earlier; or

          (c) where it is not known by whom the offence was committed, the first day on which the identity of the
    offender is known to the person aggrieved by the offence or to the police officer making investigation into the

     (2) In computing the said period, the day from which such period is to be computed shall be excluded.
     470. Exclusion of time in certain cases.—(1) In computing the period of limitation, the time during
which any person has been prosecuting with due diligence another prosecution, whether in a Court of first
instance or in a Court of appeal or revision, against the offender, shall be excluded:
    Provided that no such exclusion shall be made unless the prosecution relates to the same facts and is
prosecuted in good faith in a Court which from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable
to entertain it.
    (2) Where the institution of the prosecution in respect of an offence has been stayed by an injunction or
order, then, in computing the period of limitation, the period of the continuance of the injunction or order, the
day on which it was issued or made, and the day on which it was withdrawn, shall be excluded.
     (3) Where notice of prosecution for an offence has been given, or where, under any law for the time being
in force, the previous consent or sanction of the Government or any other authority is required for the
institution of any prosecution for an offence, then, in computing the period of limitation, the period of such

    It appears to me, on the grounds duly recorded, that a dispute, likely to induce a breach of the peace,
existed between                              (describe the parties by name and residence or residence only if
the dispute be between bodies of villagers) concerning certain                               (state concisely the

written statement of their respective claims as to the fact of actual possession of the said                 (the
subject of dispute), and being satisfied by due inquiry had thereupon, without reference to the merits of
the claim of either of the said parties to the legal right of possession, that the claim of actual possession by
the said                                  (name or names or description) is true; I do decide and declare that
he is (or they are) in possession of the said                                        (the subject of dispute) and
entitled to retain such possession until ousted by due course of law, and do strictly forbid any disturbance
of his (or their) possession in the meantime.

the dispute be between bodies of villagers) concerning certain                               (state concisely

duly called upon to state in writing their respective claims as to the fact of actual possession of the
said                 (the subject of dispute), and whereas, upon due inquiry into the said claims, I have
decided that neither of the said parties was in possession of the said                        (the subject of
dispute) (or I am unable to satisfy myself as to which of the said parties was in possession as aforesaid);


    This is to authorise and require you to attach the said                     (the subject of dispute) by
taking and keeping possession thereof, and to hold the same under attachment until the decree or order of
a competent Court determining the rights of the parties, or the claim to possession, shall have been
obtained, and to return this warrant with an endorsement certifying the manner of its execution.

exclusively by                                (describe the person or persons), and it appears to me, on due
inquiry into the same, that the said land (or water) has been open to the enjoyment of such use by the
public (or if by an individual or a class of persons, describe him or them) and (if the use can be enjoyed
throughout the year) that the said use has been enjoyed within three months of the institution of the said
inquiry (or if the use is enjoyable only at a particular season, say, “during the last of the seasons at which
the same is capable of being enjoyed”);

their interest, shall not take (or retain) possession of the said land (or water) to the exclusion of the
enjoyment of the right of use aforesaid, until he (or they) shall obtain the decree or order of a competent
Court adjudging him (or them) to be entitled to exclusive possession.
