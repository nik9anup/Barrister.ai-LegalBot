# Barrister.ai - A legal advisor bot

Barrister.ai is a legal advisor bot created using OpenAI's LLM and Langchain to answer legal queries on criminal and civil law pertinent to the Indian Jurisdiction.
The app uses ChromaDB as the Vectorstore database and gradio to create a modern front-end which is deployed both as a public and a local link.
Additonal libraries: nltk, unstructured, pypdf (for PDF files support)
Reference: langChain documentation.

This project won me 2nd place in Override'23, an 18-hour hackathon organised by the Google Student Developers Club in PESUECC. The project was developed solo by me and was chosen as the runner up among 256 teams by industry experts and mentors.
